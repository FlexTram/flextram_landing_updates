### Blog system
- Hub page at `/blog/` with article card grid
- Article template uses `blog-post.css` (based on use-case.css patterns)
- **Auto-publish workflow:** GitHub Actions runs daily at 9 AM UTC
  - Drafts in `blog/_drafts/` with filename `YYYY-MM-DD_slug.html`
  - When date arrives: moves to `blog/`, updates sitemap (with `<image:image>` block sourced from BLOG_META), adds card to hub page
  - Drafts include `BLOG_META` comment block for hub card metadata + sitemap image entry
  - Can also trigger manually from GitHub Actions tab
  - **Runs on production only** (guard added 2026-04-18): `if: github.repository == 'blackbox-engineering/flextram_landing'`. Before the guard, the workflow fired independently on origin (fork) and production, creating divergent commit SHAs with identical content and forcing a cherry-pick pattern on same-day manual pushes. On 2026-04-19 the two remotes were reconciled via `git reset --hard production/master` locally + `git push origin master --force-with-lease` — both remotes now track a single linear history. If the fork ever falls behind after an auto-publish, sync with: `git fetch production && git push origin production/master:master` (non-destructive, fork fast-forwards to production).
  - **Image-sitemap support added 2026-04-22:** workflow now emits `<image:image>` blocks in the sitemap entry by transforming BLOG_META `image:` and `image_alt:` fields (relative `../assets/img/foo.jpg` → absolute URL, `&` chars XML-escaped). Falls back gracefully (no image:image block) if BLOG_META lacks image fields. Backstory: when fan-experience-gap auto-published on 2026-04-22, its sitemap entry shipped without an image declaration since the image-sitemap extension was added 2026-04-21 (a day after the workflow was last touched). Patched same-day so future auto-publishes inherit the structural-SEO work automatically.
- **Scheduled articles:**
  - April 15: "The True Cost of the Golf Cart" (Operations)
  - April 22: "The Fan Experience Gap" (Fan Experience)
  - April 29: "Sponsorship's Untapped Frontier" (Revenue)

### AI-search query pattern (the unusual surface that's now driving real impressions)
GSC top-queries report regularly shows long, operator-heavy Boolean queries hitting the site — patterns like `"cruise industry" -"sub" -"submarine" -site:reddit.com -site:twitter.com -site:tripadvisor.com -site:youtube.com -site:yelp.com -site:booking.com -site:facebook.com -site:instagram.com -site:tiktok.com -site:wykop.pl` or `"ingredion" | "ingredion inc" | "ingredion.com"`. These are **NOT human typed queries.** They are AI search tools (Perplexity, Gemini Deep Research, ChatGPT search, Claude with web search) issuing programmatic Google queries on behalf of a researcher.

**Syntax fingerprints to recognize:**
- Long `-site:reddit.com -site:twitter.com -site:tripadvisor.com -site:youtube.com -site:yelp.com -site:booking.com -site:facebook.com -site:instagram.com -site:tiktok.com -site:wykop.pl` exclusion lists → **Perplexity / Gemini Deep Research** (strips user-generated content to focus on authoritative sources)
- Pipe-OR operators (`"x" | "y" | "z"`) → classic Google operator syntax issued by AI tools
- Lowercase `or` with parens (`(staffing or "event staff" or "temporary workers")`) → less polished, possibly ChatGPT or Claude
- Mid-query iteration visible (e.g., the same researcher refining `"cruise industry"` three times across consecutive queries with progressively tighter exclusions) → live AI research session, not separate users

**Why this matters:**
1. The traffic is HIGHEST-INTENT on the site — whoever is running these is in active B2B research mode on a specific entity (Ingredion, Capital Funding Group, Nowsta, HIMSS, named cruise destinations, named data centers). Not casual browsers. Consultants, planners, AI agents working for buyers, or buyers themselves using AI tools.
2. First sign was Session 14 (stadium-districts 3 → 152 imps on "stadium mobility infrastructure" research vocab). 2026-05-16 GSC pull confirmed it has expanded across 6+ verticals — this is now systemic, not a one-vertical fluke.
3. The optimization logic is INVERTED from classical SEO. Classical SEO chases short-tail high-volume queries. AI-tool queries are long, specific, entity-rich, operator-laden. What ranks here is **content depth + named-entity density** (specific companies, properties, dollar figures, regulations, people).

**Maintenance rules:**
- **Don't chase short-tail keywords or thin the content.** The named entities are why this surface works. Stripping them to "improve readability" would kill the highest-intent traffic on the site.
- **Every named company / venue / property / dollar figure / person / regulation in body copy is a future hit on this surface.** Treat citation density as a feature, not a stylistic cost.
- **Watch CTR on these queries specifically.** Impressions are confirmed; the open question is whether AI tools click through (sending GA4 sessions) or just cite the URL without a click (AI Overviews / Perplexity citation — different attribution path, may show as `(direct)` or `gemini.google.com` referrals).
- **The cruise-iteration signal** (same researcher refining the same query 3 times) is the cleanest argument for publishing destination-by-destination cruise content (Half Moon Cay, Castaway Cay, Lighthouse Point, Royal Beach Club Nassau) — that researcher needs depth and is digging. Same logic applies whenever you see iterative queries in a vertical.

### Operator's Atlas — proposed format for capturing the AI-search surface (status: parked 2026-05-16, revisit 2026-05-23)
**The concept:** a new IA section at `/atlas/` (separate from `/blog/`, `/solutions/`, `/resources/`) housing structured directories of named entities per vertical — `/atlas/cruise-destinations`, `/atlas/data-center-campuses`, `/atlas/nfl-stadiums`, etc. Each atlas is a practitioner-compiled reference page that pairs entity density (what AI-search tools surface) with editorial commentary per entry (what defends the page against scrapers + makes it useful to humans).

**Format per atlas (proposed):**
1. Editorial intro (300–400 words) — why this category, who the atlas is for, what FlexTram's perspective adds
2. Entity entries (15–25, each ~80–150 words) — H3 with anchor ID + parent/owner + key facts one-liner (acreage, year, capacity, current transit) + 2–3 sentences of **FlexTram-specific operational observation** (the moat — the thing only practitioners can write)
3. Patterns across the category (~400 words) — recurring operational themes
4. What's coming (~200 words) — under construction / rumored / recently opened (lets the page absorb new entities without restructure)
5. Sources + "Last updated" date (invites bookmarking + gives Google a freshness signal)

**Why "atlas" not "list"/"guide":** "list" reads as SEO content marketing (low trust); "guide" implies how-to (wrong frame); "atlas" carries the practitioner-compiled-reference connotation — the kind of document a consultant bookmarks.

**Why a new `/atlas/` IA section, not `/blog/`:** different mental model — atlas pages are reference, blog pages are editorial, solution pages are buyer-conversion. Clean URL pattern enables future expansion (one per vertical) without polluting blog grid.

**Sequencing if approved:**
1. **First atlas: cruise destinations.** The GSC 2026-05-16 signal showed an AI researcher iterating cruise queries 3 times — clearest documented demand for vertical depth. Anchor entries: CocoCay, Labadee, Royal Beach Club Nassau, Celebration Key, Half Moon Cay, Castaway Cay, Lighthouse Point, Great Stirrup Cay, Harvest Caye, Ocean Cay (10 obvious starters; could extend to 15–20 with Bahama Out Islands, private island programs).
2. **Watch the first atlas for 4–6 weeks** before committing to a second. Maintenance is the real risk — three atlases is fine; twelve abandoned atlases is a "this site is dead" signal.
3. **Likely candidates 2 and 3:** data center campuses (extends an already-strong cluster) and Power 4 collegiate athletics venues (FSU testimonial already opens the door).

**Open questions to resolve when revisiting (2026-05-23):**
- IA placement: `/atlas/cruise-destinations` vs `/atlas/cruise-destinations/index.html` vs nested `/atlas/cruise/destinations` (depends on whether we expect multiple atlas-per-vertical sub-pages later)
- Schema: Dataset markup? ItemList? Both? Or just BlogPosting + BreadcrumbList like the rest of the site?
- Nav placement: does the main nav need an "Atlas" link, or is atlas-as-reference content people land on via search and bookmark (no nav presence)?
- Editorial standard: how much operational commentary per entry is enough? 2 sentences? A paragraph? The moat depends on this answer.

### Publish-workflow rules (run on EVERY new blog post, in the same commit as the HTML)
1. **Inbound cross-links (Session 19 rule).** Add 1–2 inline anchor links from existing posts in the natural cluster pointing at the new post. Avoids the orphan-on-publish pattern that triggered two link-graph audits in Session 19. Inline anchor text > grid card for link authority.
2. **llms.txt update (Session 25 rule).** Add the new post to [llms.txt](llms.txt) in the same commit. Placement rules:
   - **One post = one home** (don't double-list under multiple section headers — dilutes which header an LLM treats as authoritative)
   - **A section needs ~3 posts to justify its own header.** Single-post sections look like padding to a retrieval model. Below 3, file under the broader "Industry analysis (flagship)" section or the nearest vertical cluster.
   - **Section order = importance.** Top of file = LLMs see first. Solutions hub stays top, then flagship Industry analysis, then vertical clusters roughly in revenue-priority order.
   - Most AI-search traffic in GA4 (gemini.google.com referrals since Session 8) is **buyer queries** ("anyone making trams for X?"), not philosophical queries — so lean vertical-first, thesis-second when in doubt.
3. **Sitemap entry** (with `<image:image>` block + lastmod = today) — auto-publish workflow handles this for scheduled drafts, but manual publishes must add it by hand.
4. **Blog hub card** at top of "More articles" grid (or featured slot if displacing the manifesto).
5. **Hero image variants** — 1200/640 JPG + WebP, per the Session 17 site-wide WebP pattern. Python PIL script template: see Session 18 (cruise-destination-transit) or Session 20 (mega-resort-transit).

### Contact form / Formspree forms (multi-form architecture as of 2026-05-22)
The site uses **multiple Formspree forms**, not one. Worth knowing because the shared `mvzzoarr` form is confirmed spam-flooded.

- **`mvzzoarr` ("Inquiry From Website")** — the original shared endpoint. The homepage contact form (form ID `#contact-form` — anchor target from all site-wide "Get in Touch" CTAs), `/request-a-bid`, and `/procurement-packet` all post here.
  - **Session 26 finding:** this form is drowning in spam — Formspree dashboard shows ~188 submissions / 30 days, the spam line dominates, inbox line near zero. Formspree's per-form spam filter classifies + silently drops email notifications (submission still appears in dashboard's Spam tab, but no email goes out).
  - **Open question** in TODOs: are real leads through the contact / bid / procurement forms actually reaching Joseph's inbox, or being spam-buried like the calculator's first test was? If buried → replicate the calculator's fix (dedicated form + spam-filter relaxed + honeypot guard).
- **`mykvjpbo` ("Savings Calculator")** — dedicated form for `/savings-calculator` (created Session 26). Async multipart FormData POST from the calculator's email gate. **Spam filter deliberately disabled** on this form (low-volume, dedicated, JS honeypot still active via the `_gotcha` field check before submission). Calc fields land intact with the lead (`fleet`, `flextrams_needed`, `annual_savings_range`, `five_year_range`).
- **`Flyer V2`** — separate Formspree form tied to the flextram-flyer slick deck (different repo). Not used by main site forms.

All solution page and blog "Get in Touch" CTAs link to `/#contact-form`. Form labels properly associated with inputs for accessibility across all forms.

### Client logos in carousel (26)
Tesla, Amazon, NASCAR, Live Nation, AEG, Coachella, Stagecoach, Lollapalooza, Bonnaroo, EDC, Rolling Loud, Insomniac, C3 Presents, Sick New World, FloydFest, When We Were Young, Lovers & Friends, Innings Festival, Desert Daze, Besame Mucho, FSU, Ingredion, LAZ Parking, Savannah Bananas, Dreamstate, ZA Queen Mary

### Vehicle specs (used across all pages)
- Passenger capacity: 16-27 seated
- ADA compliant: Standard
- Operators needed: 1 driver
- **NOT electric** -- use "compact", "small format", or "agile" (never "electric")
- Top speed and operating range removed (not relevant to marketing)

### Navigation
- All pages have: Solutions, Blog, Contact links
- Homepage nav: inline-styled white links over video hero
- Solutions + Blog pages: `.nav-links` with `.nav-link` classes
- Logo links to `/` on all pages (no target="_blank")

### CNAME
Set to `www.flextram.com`

## Dev server
Use the Claude Preview tool with `.claude/launch.json`, or run manually:
```
npx http-server -p 8080 -c-1
```
Then open http://localhost:8080

## Git workflow
```bash
# Push to both remotes (fork + production)
git add [files] && git commit -m "message"
git push origin master && git push production master
```
Note: `gh` CLI installed at `/usr/local/bin/gh`, authenticated as FlexTram account with `workflow` scope.

**⚠ gh auth account-switching gotcha — engineered away by `scripts/setup-credentials.sh`.** Two GitHub accounts are logged into the `gh` CLI keychain (`jmbradley` personal + `FlexTram` org). Without the credential-helper setup, pushes use the *active* `gh` account's token; if `jmbradley` is active, both pushes return `403 Permission denied to jmbradley`. **Run once per fresh clone:**
```bash
./scripts/setup-credentials.sh
```
This pins git's credential resolution for both flextram remotes to the FlexTram token specifically — the active `gh` account becomes irrelevant for these pushes. Verified working with either account active.

**If you skipped the setup and hit the 403** (symptom: `remote: Permission to <repo> denied to jmbradley`): run `gh auth switch --user FlexTram` and retry. Then run `./scripts/setup-credentials.sh` so it doesn't happen again.

Worktree push pattern from Session 20 still applies: `git push origin HEAD:master && git push production HEAD:master`.

## Manual blog publish — IndexNow notification
After pushing a new blog post (or any URL with structurally meaningful changes) to production, run a one-line IndexNow submission so Bing / DuckDuckGo / Yandex / Seznam recrawl within hours instead of days. Auto-publish via GitHub Actions already handles this automatically (see `.github/workflows/publish-drafts.yml` Notify IndexNow step). For manual publishes, use:
```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "IndexNow: HTTP %{http_code}\n" -X POST "https://api.indexnow.org/indexnow" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \
  -d '{"host":"www.flextram.com","key":"3b5dd366e4db30dd7e6249ecda05e4c4","keyLocation":"https://www.flextram.com/3b5dd366e4db30dd7e6249ecda05e4c4.txt","urlList":["https://www.flextram.com/blog/NEW-SLUG"]}'
```
Replace `NEW-SLUG` with the published URL(s). Add additional URLs to the `urlList` array (comma-separated strings) if cluster pieces also got inbound links and should be recrawled. Success = HTTP 200 or 202. Failures are non-fatal — Bing will still find the post via organic crawl, just slower.

### Session 8 (2026-04-11 to 2026-04-15) -- Content Sprint, Airport-FBO Rewrite, Performance Cleanup

**Content published (6 new blog posts):**
- Festival Season Is Here (Coachella context, front-of-house/back-of-house framing)
- Data Center Construction People-Moving Problem (hyperscale campus transit gap)
- Factory Workers Walking Two Hours (warehouse shift-change transit waste)

### Session 10 (2026-04-16 to 2026-04-17) — Content expansion, conversion funnel, performance overhaul, repo cleanup

Two-day mega-sprint. Covered in three themes: new content + tone fix, full conversion funnel build-out, and a deep performance pass that lifted every ranking-critical page into the 75-90+ Lighthouse mobile range.

**Content (3 new published blog posts + 1 major solution-page rewrite):**
- Published "Shuttle Bus vs. FlexTram: The Real Cost of Moving People Inside Your Event" (`/blog/shuttle-bus-vs-flextram`, ~2,400 words, Operations & Economics)
  - Close-proximity scope protection in title, callout, opening, and SEO metadata
  - Named examples: Hard Rock Stadium (25-min rideshare walk), Bonnaroo (45-60 min campsite walks), Echo Park Speedway (hour-long cart hold), PGA Valhalla (Ryan Ogle quote), THE PLAYERS Championship
  - Target keyword cluster proven by PVGP inbound: "shuttle bus alternative"
- Published "Your Event Isn't at a Stadium. It's at a Park, a Beach, or a Street." (`/blog/venue-isnt-a-stadium`, ~2,400 words, NEW "Venue Planning" category)
  - Opens the "temporary venue mobility" category
  - X Games hero photo (Huntington Beach vert ramps)
  - Named examples: US Open of Surfing, AVP Long Beach, Grand Prix of Long Beach (1.97mi/180K spectators), Baltimore GP (cautionary tale, permits pulled 2013)
  - PVGP hinted at as "450-acre urban park motorsport festival" — not named pending usage rights
- Published "Curb to Gate: Why the Fan Journey Became the Product at Live Events" (`/blog/curb-to-gate-fan-journey`, ~2,000 words, Industry Analysis)
  - Parking-industry positioning piece targeting LAZ, Propark Mobility, Metropolis, ParkHub, Hollywood Park
  - Opens partnership conversation with parking operators (new GTM angle)
  - All cited companies + $ figures + quotes have source URLs for verification
- Rewrote `solutions/airport-fbo.html` hero + first H2 + pain cards
  - Root cause of 3s engagement: tone was accusatory ("your FBO is failing"), not a performance issue (Lighthouse confirmed: worse-performing stadiums page kept 10s engagement with same template)
  - Mirror stadiums-arenas pattern: solution-first H1, observational hero, investigative H2 ("What ramp transport is really costing you"), situational pain card titles
  - Kept Gulfstream hero photo, all specs/comparison tables/FAQ unchanged

**Conversion funnel (full build):**
- Blog post CTA surface (sticky + mid-article + bottom) across all 14 content posts + hub
  - Solves measured problem: yesterday 167 blog views drove 0 CTA clicks (homepage's 14.3% CTA rate was carrying entire site)
  - Sticky floating button always visible
  - Mid-article CTA with topic-specific copy per post (13 unique variants)
- Unified "Request Info" CTAs to orange pill site-wide via CSS descendant selectors (54 buttons across nav, sticky, blog hub, blog post bottoms, solution page heroes, solution mid-page blocks)
  - Kept black `.btn-primary` for form SUBMIT buttons and secondary actions (thank-you cards, inline tier-2 CTAs, related-solution cards)
  - Zero HTML edits — pure CSS consolidation
- Built `/request-a-bid` (4-step procurement form) + `/request-a-bid-received` (thank-you)
  - 15 structured fields (event, scope, contact, extras) vs. homepage's 3
  - Service model routing: Rental / Turnkey / Advise us
  - Reuses existing Formspree endpoint with `source=bid_request` hidden tag
  - Thank-you page embeds product slick (flextram.github.io/flextram-flyer/v1/), Calendly, and direct email as 3 conversion paths
- Integrated Calendly (https://calendly.com/jb-flextram/30min) as third conversion path site-wide
  - Homepage: subtle link below contact form
  - Bid form intro: "if your timeline is tight, book a 30-min call and we'll accelerate"
  - Bid thank-you: featured option
- Updated homepage contact section with buyer-language (based on Hinterland/Coachella/Canada inquiry diction analysis)
  - Service-area statement: "Deploying at events across the United States. Rentals, leases, and turnkey plans available."
  - Changed submit button "Send" → "Request Quote"
  - Subtle procurement link to `/request-a-bid`
- Updated slick repo (flextram-flyer/v1/): SEND → REQUEST QUOTE, added FLEXTRAM.COM back-link, fixed truncated footer HTML (file had ended mid-tag `<div st`), added "SOURCING A LARGE DEPLOYMENT? REQUEST A BID →" link back to main site
- Buyer-language SEO push (added rental keywords to 7 event-type solution pages + solutions hub meta/OG/Twitter descriptions)

**Analytics (GA4 event coverage):**
- `cta_click` tracking across bid funnel with `cta_type` + `cta_location` parameters (homepage, bid_form_page, bid_thanks_page — sliceable by type: contact_form / bid_form / calendly / slick / email)
- `bid_request_submit` fires on form submission
- `bid_request_received` fires on thank-you page load (conversion event)
- Existing `form_visible`, `form_start`, `form_submit` preserved

**Fact-check audit (2026-04-17):** See dedicated section below. 20/27 CRITICAL claims verified, 2 attribution drifts fixed (EPI 9.5% stat, NACFE framing), 3 left as-is per low-risk call.

## Fact-check audit (2026-04-17)

Ran a systematic audit across all 15 published blog posts + 3 drafts to catch any hallucinated factual claims. **91 claims flagged for review — 27 CRITICAL, 44 IMPORTANT, 20 MINOR.** Web-verified 20 of 27 CRITICAL claims against live source URLs.

**Results:**
- **20 CRITICAL claims verified accurate** — real people, real quotes, real regulations, exact matches against source URLs. Named-person quotes (Ryan Ogle/PGA, Jonathan Berk/The National, Matt Sebek/CITY SC, Jason Soucy/PGA, Brad Chambers/JLL, Carrie Walton Penner/Broncos, Andrew Elmer/Populous, Bill Cahill/HNTB) all check out. Regulations (FMCSA IFR Sept 2025, DOT 2010 cruise ADA, Carnival 2015 settlement, ABA 48-hour rule) all real and correctly characterized. Source claims (Hard Rock A-Z guide, Echo Park Speedway, Ticket Fairy, HOK pillars, Burns & McDonnell, Boldyn 55% stat, THE PLAYERS parking warning) all exact matches.
- **2 attribution drifts fixed** (commit `d7fb874`):
  1. `shuttle-bus-vs-flextram.html` — "9.5% bus driver shortage" was mis-attributed to "federal legislation introduced in 2026." Real source is the Economic Policy Institute. Fixed: re-attributed to EPI, separated real 2026 legislation (Driving Forward Act) reference, added specific FMCSA IFR date (Sept 29, 2025) + Feb 2026 final rule note.
  2. `world-cup-fan-first-mobility.html` — NACFE reference described their piece as general "operational analysis of what it'll take to move fans." Real piece is the "AV Game Day Playbook" about autonomous vehicles at mega-events. Tightened to match the AV framing.
- **3 unverified claims left as-is per low-risk assessment:**
  1. Sander van't Noordende (Randstad CEO) quote in data-center-crew-retention.html — CEO is real, thesis verified as his documented position, exact quote's specific CNBC source couldn't be located but paraphrase holds.
  2. National Bus Sales "wait an hour or more" quote in shuttle-bus-vs-flextram.html — cited URL returned 404 (link rot, not fabrication).
  3. Bonnaroo accessibility claims in shuttle-bus-vs-flextram.html — support URL returned 403 (blocked by WAF, not confirmed wrong). Bonnaroo is a FlexTram client per context.

**Pattern observed:** Named-person quotes were all real and accurate. Risk concentrated in stat-to-source attribution (which number came from which report) — that's now caught. No hallucinated people, no fabricated regulations, no invented client deployments.

**Client deployment "8 FlexTrams replaced 300 carts / 1,300 total carts at Southern California site":** Confirmed accurate by client. Both phrasings (across 5+ posts) describe the same real deployment from different angles.

### Session 11 (2026-04-18 to 2026-04-19) — GA4 cleanup, contact UX redesign, workflow hardening, LAZ-facing content, OG image, remote reconciliation

**Analytics hygiene:**
- **Diagnosed form-bot activity.** 6 `form_submit` events in GA4 with 0 actual inbound emails. Root cause: GA4 Enhanced Measurement auto-fires `form_submit` on any browser submit event — our honeypot (`_gotcha`) catches them server-side at Formspree, but GA4 inflates the count client-side. Smoking-gun signal: `form_submit` (6) > `form_start` (5) — textbook bot pattern (bots skip focus events). Confirmed in Formspree spam log.
- **Disabled GA4 Enhanced Measurement "Form interactions"** via Admin → Data streams → Enhanced measurement gear. Conversion signal is now clean: only custom events fire (`form_submit_success`, `bid_request_submit`, `bid_request_received`). `form_submit` and `form_start` will disappear from events list within 24–48 hrs of tomorrow's data.
- **"Flex tram" position drop investigation.** GSC showed position 4.5 → 14 — flagged as potential ranking regression. Determined to be sample-composition noise at low impression count (8 impressions). User verified page 1 SERP placement directly. Not a real drop.

**Homepage contact section UX redesign (shipped):**
- Problem: "Request a formal bid" and "Book a 30-min call" CTAs were inline orange text links above the form, reading as afterthoughts (measured: lowest click-through in the CTA stack).
- Researched B2B multi-path contact form best practices (Venture Harbour, VWO, Trajectory Web Design, Tiller Digital, Calendly Help). Pattern convergence: persona-matched alt CTAs with visual hierarchy subordinate to primary form.
- Shipped: promoted both to structured outlined pill cards BELOW the form (no longer competing for attention above it). Each carries persona sub-label: "For RFPs and large deployments" / "Talk live with Joseph this week." Divider "OR, DEPENDING ON YOUR TIMELINE" reframes them as situational branches.
- CSS scoped via `.contact-alt-*` classes inlined with critical CSS on [index.html](index.html). Ghost treatment (transparent fill, white border) preserves orange filled pill as primary. Mobile: stacks vertically. Hover: orange border + subtle tint + 2px lift + arrow nudge.

**Auto-publish workflow hardening:**
- Root cause of earlier divergence documented: workflow was installed on BOTH remotes (origin fork + production) and each ran on its own cron, creating divergent commit SHAs with identical content — forcing a cherry-pick pattern on any same-day manual push.
- Shipped: `if: github.repository == 'blackbox-engineering/flextram_landing'` guard on the publish job. Production is now the single source of truth for auto-publishes. Fork can be synced on-demand with `git fetch production && git push origin production/master:master`.
- Documented in "Blog system" section above + comment inline in the workflow file.
- Today's pre-guard divergence persists permanently (origin and production had different auto-publish SHAs from this morning) — cosmetic, not functional. All future commits stay aligned.

**Content published:**
- **"The Parking Lot Is Becoming a Mobility Origin. Here's the Chapter That Completes the Story."** (`/blog/parking-lot-mobility-origin`, ~3,400 words, Industry Vision). LAZ-facing strategic piece — six transformations the parking lot has already absorbed (EV charging, micro-warehousing, vertiports, micromobility hubs, computer vision platforms, ghost kitchens) + the seventh unnamed transformation (human mobility). Frames FlexTram as the partner layer that completes the fan-journey product.
- **Positioning discipline:** buried in the blog grid directly above `curb-to-gate-fan-journey` for thematic clustering. Sitemap priority 0.5 (vs manifesto's 0.8). Per client direction: "feel discovered if LAZ comes across it, not broadcast." Named LAZ / Lazowski / Charge Where You Park / LAZ Live! contextually to support discovery without pitching — reads as industry analysis.
- Cited sources: 2021 LAZ/Perch Mobility press release (Mass Transit Mag), 2025 LAZ/Epic Charging investment (AI Journ), 2024 Metropolis/SP+ acquisition ($1.5B), December 2025 LAZ Live! 100-venue milestone (PRWeb, including Derek Schiller / Atlanta Braves CEO quote).
- 5 FAQs, BreadcrumbList + BlogPosting + FAQPage + Organization JSON-LD, OG/Twitter meta, canonical, keywords, preload hints, 640px + 1200px hero variants.

**Verified:**
- April 18 auto-publish fired on both remotes — "The Hidden Cost of Making Fans Walk" is live on flextram.com. (Confirms the Session 9 date-bug fix is working.)
- Homepage contact section, parking-mobility-origin post, and workflow guard all confirmed live on production.

**Day 2 (2026-04-19):**
- **Homepage OG image swapped** to branded 1200×630 "Built to Move" fleet shot (`assets/img/og-flextram-v1.jpg`). Replaces generic Paper Kit placeholder `pic3.JPG` (400×399). Updates both `og:image` and `twitter:image`; adds explicit `og:image:width`/`og:image:height`/`og:image:alt` for platform rendering and accessibility. Versioned filename (`-v1`) so future swaps bypass iMessage's aggressive cache.
- **Site-wide OG image sweep** — same `og-flextram-v1.jpg` swapped onto the 7 other pages still using `pic3.JPG`: `landing-page.html`, `solutions/index.html` (hub), `blog/index.html` (hub), `solutions/labor-companies.html`, `solutions/convention-centers.html`, `solutions/golf-courses.html`, `solutions/planned-communities.html`. Every page on flextram.com now has a branded link preview when shared to iMessage/Slack/LinkedIn/etc. Individual solution + blog posts were already using their own hero images as OG images and were unaffected. Vertical-specific custom OG images (e.g., golf-on-course for `golf-courses.html`) remain future-state.
- **Remote SHA reconciliation.** The pre-guard divergence from 2026-04-18 had persisted: origin and production were forever offset by one SHA (same content, different commits), forcing cherry-picks on every push. Verified identical content (`git diff origin/master production/master --stat` → empty), then `git reset --hard production/master` locally and `git push origin master --force-with-lease`. Both remotes + local now at single SHA (`3c8e55d` at time of reconciliation). Cherry-pick pattern retired.
- **Safety check during reconciliation:** preserved uncommitted `.claude/settings.local.json` changes via stash, confirmed only three clones exist (origin, production, local), confirmed no external services reference pre-reconciliation origin SHAs.

**Airport-FBO page — vocabulary rewrite (second attempt):**
- Session 10 fixed tone (accusatory → investigative), but engagement stayed at ~3s. Diagnosed on re-visit: tone was addressed, but page still used venue-mobility language retargeted at FBOs. FBO buyers search for "crew car," "ramp transport," "quick turn," "transient," "Part 135" — not "parking" or "fans." Buyers pattern-match "this isn't for me" within 3 seconds.
- Researched FBO industry vocabulary by extracting service language from AeroCenters (FBO definition / service categories) + Universal Aviation (FBO ground support services). Key finding: **"Crew Car"** is a named service category FBO buyers already have a mental bucket for; FlexTram needed to claim it explicitly.
- Rewrote across the page with FBO-native vocabulary (same structural bones, all edits vocabulary-only):
  - Title/meta/OG/Twitter: "FBO Crew Transport & Ramp Coordination"
  - Hero H1: "Crew transport. Passenger handling. Built for the quick turn."
  - Hero subtitle: names flight crew / charter passengers / transient principals
  - Pain cards: crew car capacity gap, FOD/wingtip/prop-wash risk, transient-volume seasonality, based-vs-transient client psychology
  - Solution block: line services, FOD risk, block-in to line-service-start timing
  - Use-case pills: flight crew transport, VIP & principal arrivals, hangar-to-FBO shuttle, quick-turn ramp movement, Part 135 operations
  - FAQ: 4 new FBO-native questions (crew car comparison, quick-turn integration, Part 135 fit, VIP/principal transport) + updated 2 existing
  - Keywords meta: expanded with FBO search terms
  - CTA block: "right-size your ramp fleet," asks for based vs. transient mix + crew car count + ramp layout
- Hypothesis: engagement climbs from 3s toward 10s+ because buyers now pattern-match "this is for me" in the first three seconds. Monitor 48-72 hrs.

**Published "Your Courtesy Shuttle Is Doing More Work Than Your Org Chart Admits"** (`/blog/courtesy-shuttle-load-bearing`, ~1,900 words, Stadiums & Arenas). Stadium-ops piece reframing the courtesy shuttle as load-bearing infrastructure rather than a procurement line item. Opens with an AT&T Stadium scene-setting anecdote, uses an Arlington/Globe Life Field pedicab cautionary tale (NBC 5 DFW sourced), names the four operational levers that move when a shuttle becomes a system (throughput forecastability, liability/training consolidation, vehicle as brand/wayfinding/sponsorship, flexibility inside a standard), and closes with the SoCal 300-carts-to-8-trams case study. Buried mid-grid directly above `stadium-districts-mixed-use-transportation` for thematic clustering with the other stadium-ops posts. Sitemap priority 0.5 (discoverable-not-broadcast treatment, same as parking-mobility-origin). Full SEO + 5 FAQs + related-reading cluster linking to stadiums-arenas, football-stadiums, football-parking blog, stadium-districts blog.

**Blog mid-article CTA fix:**
- User-spotted regression on `/blog/data-center-crew-retention`: the mid-article `.post-cta-inline` Request Info button was rendering as dark-background + teal-underlined text instead of the expected clean black pill or orange pill.
- Root cause: Session 10's orange-pill unification covered `.blog-cta-strip`, `.post-cta`, `.cta-block`, `.hero-ctas` but missed `.post-cta-inline`. The "tier-2 black pill" fallback was supposed to preserve visual variety for mid-article CTAs, but in practice `.post-content a { color: teal; text-decoration: underline; }` cascaded into the button, producing a broken-looking hybrid on 15+ blog posts.
- Fix: promoted `.post-cta-inline .btn-primary` into the orange pill selector family (one CSS edit in `assets/css/global.css`). Every mid-article CTA across all blog posts now renders consistent with the primary CTA treatment. Updated the inline comment above the selector block to record the decision.
- Full-site CTA audit confirmed no other orphans: bid thank-you page's three black-pill buttons render cleanly (outside `.post-content`, no cascade collision) and are legitimate tier-2 next-step options on a post-conversion page.

### Session 12 (2026-04-19 continued) — GA4 instrumentation completion + GSC indexing triage

**GA4 custom dimensions registered (Admin → Custom definitions):** Forward CTA-funnel measurement was being collected but invisible because GA4 requires custom event parameters to be registered as custom dimensions before they appear in any report or Explore. The 14 historical `cta_click` events fired before this session are stuck as "(not set)" — that data is permanently lost for slicing, but every event from 2026-04-19 forward is fully sliceable. Registered (all Event scope):
- `CTA Type` → parameter `cta_type` (values: contact_form / bid_form / calendly / slick / email / other)
- `CTA Location` → parameter `cta_location` (values: nav / body / bid_form_page / bid_thanks_page)
- `Service Model` → parameter `service_model` (bid form routing: rental / turnkey / advise)
- `Source Tag` → parameter `source` (distinguishes bid_request vs contact)

**Note on GA4 dropdown UX trap:** when registering `cta_type` the dropdown only suggested `cta_text` and `cta_location` (it autocompletes from recently-indexed parameter names). The Event parameter field accepts free-typed values — `cta_type` was typed manually and registered correctly. This is GA4's biggest stumbling block for first-time custom-dimension setup; document so next session doesn't waste time.

**Key Events marked (Admin → Events → Recent events tab → star icon):**
- `bid_request_received` (hard conversion — landed on /request-a-bid-received)
- `form_submit_success` (hard conversion — homepage contact form actually submitted)
- `bid_request_submit` (intent signal — submit clicked, fires before redirect)
- `cta_click` (funnel signal — every meaningful CTA click)

The 3 GA4 default key-event templates (`close_convert_lead`, `purchase`, `qualify_lead`) were left unstarred and untouched — they don't fire on this site, are noise.

**GSC indexing triage (Page indexing report):**
- "Crawled — currently not indexed" (1 page, validation Failed) and "Alternate page with proper canonical tag" (1 page) were both flagging the same URL: `/blog/cruise-terminals-people-moving.html`. Verified the canonical pretty URL `/blog/cruise-terminals-people-moving` IS indexed via URL Inspection. Both flags are working-as-designed: GitHub Pages serves both `.html` and pretty URL, the canonical tag tells Google to prefer the pretty URL, Google complies and shelves the `.html`. The "Failed" validation just means Google won't index the duplicate — exactly what the canonical is designed to prevent. **No action needed; ignore both flags permanently.**
- "Discovered — currently not indexed" (22 pages, validation Started): Google knows about them via sitemap but hasn't crawled. Normal for a young domain with growing content library. Long-term levers: backlinks (AMS Event Rentals outreach in TODO), internal linking depth (already strong post-Session 8/10), time, and manual indexing requests via URL Inspection (~10/day per property limit). Priority URLs to manually request: `/solutions/airport-fbo` (just rewrote with FBO vocab — needs recrawl), `/request-a-bid` (conversion page), `/blog/courtesy-shuttle-load-bearing` + `/blog/parking-lot-mobility-origin` (newly published, accelerate discovery), `/solutions/stadiums-arenas`, `/solutions/raceways-motorsports` (PVGP relevance), `/solutions/festivals-events` (Hinterland relevance).

**Snapshot of GA4 state at session end (last 28 days):**
- Total: 1,747 events / 167 users / 246 sessions / 21s avg engagement
- Channels: Direct 76.83% (189 sess / 13s) | Organic 19.92% (49 sess / 49s / 77.55% engagement rate — excellent quality) | Unassigned 4.47% | Referral 2.44% (49s engagement)
- `cta_click`: 14 events / 8 users (parameter slicing starts fresh today)
- `form_visible` 33 → `form_start` 6 → `form_submit_success` (need to confirm count post-Enhanced-Measurement-toggle)
- `form_submit` ghost events (the GA4 auto-event from Enhanced Measurement) confirmed dropped out of top 10 — Session 11's toggle fix worked
- Top pages by views: `/` (254), `/blog/` (93, 46s), `/solutions/` (56, 36s), `/solutions/airport-fbo.html` (19, **3s** — vocabulary rewrite shipped 2026-04-19, this snapshot likely predates the data window), `/request-a-bid` (9 views, 23s engagement — first real traffic to bid funnel since launch)

**GSC organic queries (28-day):** `flextram` position 1.06 / 23.53% CTR (4 clicks / 17 imps — branded search locked in). `flex tram` position 14 (was 4.5 — small-sample noise, 8 imps). `flextrolley` and `flex trolley` still at positions 65–80 despite SEO push (need backlinks not body text). AI-operator queries continuing: "data center construction -site:reddit..." surfacing the data-center post at position 6.

**What changes for next session:**
- The CTA Type / CTA Location custom dimensions now exist. Build the Explore (Variables: add CTA Type dim + Event count metric; Settings: rows=CTA Type, values=Event count, filter Event name=`cta_click`) on or after 2026-04-22 (3 days of forward data minimum) to verify the homepage CTA redesign is catching bid_form / Calendly clicks vs only contact_form. That's the verdict on Session 11's UX work.
- Conversion events are now first-class. Looker Studio dashboards or GA4 native Funnel explorations will work properly.

### Session 13 (2026-04-20) — New post + canonical/sitemap hygiene sweep

**Content:**
- Published "Cities Solved This 100 Years Ago. Why Haven't Venues?" (`/blog/cities-solved-this`, ~2,100 words, Industry). Manifesto-style piece reframing venue transportation in urban transit terms — fixed routes, posted schedules, high-capacity shared vehicles, accessibility built-in. Inverts the urbanist's "last mile" problem into the venue "first mile." Hero: Paris Métro Pigalle (Art Nouveau station entrance with tourists studying a subway map). Buried position 1 in "More articles" grid (high-quality industry think-piece, but not displacing the featured "why isn't transportation on the list" manifesto). Sitemap priority 0.7. Full SEO: BlogPosting + FAQPage + BreadcrumbList + Organization JSON-LD, OG/Twitter, canonical, 5 FAQs, related-reading cluster (why-isnt-transportation-assumed, onsite-transportation-paradigm, stadiums-arenas, festivals-events).

**SEO consistency audit + fixes:**
- **Diagnosed link-equity split on solution pages from GA4.** GA4 Pages report showed `/solutions/airport-fbo.html` (19 views, 3s) AND `/solutions/airport-fbo` (11 views, 1s) both receiving live traffic — same page, two URLs, splitting metrics. Root cause: solutions hub `ItemList` JSON-LD pointed all 19 entries to `.html` URLs while canonical tags + sitemap pointed to pretty URLs. Google was crawling/serving both, splitting link equity 19 ways across the entire solutions catalog. Fixed: dropped `.html` from all 19 ItemList URLs in `solutions/index.html`. ItemList → canonical → sitemap now agree on the pretty-URL form.
- **Bulk-refreshed sitemap lastmod dates.** Audit found 37 of 43 sitemap entries had stale `lastmod` (mostly stuck at 2026-04-14 despite edits through 4/19). Stale lastmod actively discourages Google from recrawling — telling Google "nothing changed" when in fact the airport-fbo vocab rewrite, ItemList .html fix, and other recent work were all sitting unannounced. Wrote a Python script that pulls each URL's actual most-recent git commit date and updates `lastmod` accordingly. 37 entries updated to true last-edit dates; 6 already-fresh entries left alone.
- **Noindexed `landing-page.html`.** Audit found it's a Paper Kit 2 PRO template artifact that overlaps ~95% with the homepage on title, meta description, H1, and value prop — but had no `noindex` tag and was missing from sitemap (indexing limbo). Adding to sitemap would create a near-duplicate competing with `/` for the brand keyword cluster (`flextram` currently at position 1.06 — adding a duplicate risks splitting that ranking). Better fix: explicit `noindex,follow` so Google stops competing it against `/`, while the URL stays accessible if any pre-existing direct links resolve there. Inline HTML comment documents the reasoning. Future option: rebuild as a substantively distinct landing page (e.g., `/event-trams` or `/for-festivals`) with its own keyword cluster, not as a clone of `/`.
- **Other audits clean.** Canonical vs OG URL match across all pages. No duplicate title tags. No duplicate meta descriptions. No `.html` self-references in BreadcrumbList JSON-LD. `request-a-bid-received` correctly excluded (noindex,follow + missing canonical/og/sitemap is standard thank-you-page pattern). `system.html` correctly excluded (noindex,nofollow easter egg).

**Structural SEO + safety mini-sweep (the "anything else like this" follow-up audit):**
- **Added `rel="noopener"` to 11 `target="_blank"` external links** across 4 blog posts (football-parking-lot-weakest-link, hidden-cost-of-making-fans-walk, stadium-districts-mixed-use-transportation, world-cup-fan-first-mobility). Security best practice — without `noopener`, the linked third-party page can call `window.opener.location` and redirect the original tab. Modern browsers (Chrome 88+) implicitly add it, but Lighthouse Best Practices still flags the absence. Mechanical Python regex pass; verified no rel-attr conflicts site-wide before running.
- **Corrected 3 wildly-wrong `wordCount` values in BlogPosting JSON-LD.** data-center-construction-people-moving claimed 2800 words (actual ~1300), factory-workers-walking-two-hours claimed 2600 (actual ~1300), festival-season-here claimed 1800 (actual ~1100). Schema validators don't penalize hard for this but it's a credibility signal — corrected to rounded actual counts.
- **Tightened meta descriptions on 4 highest-traffic pages** (homepage, solutions hub, blog hub, today's `cities-solved-this` post). All were 187–229 chars (truncated mid-sentence in SERPs). Now 108–157 chars, all under the 160 truncation boundary, all preserve keyword clusters. Synced across `<meta name="description">`, `twitter:description`, and `og:description` where present. Also lifted blog hub title from 23 chars ("Blog — FlexTram Systems") to 65 chars ("FlexTram Blog | Onsite Transportation & Venue Operations Insights") — captures more keywords for hub-page queries.
- **Long-tail meta description sweep (30 pages) intentionally deferred** to tomorrow. Each is per-page editorial, best done in one batch session. Logged as a TODO with the audit script invocation for next-session continuity.
- **Audits clean (no action needed):** broken internal links (zero), HTTP/non-HTTPS canonicals (zero), multiple H1 tags per page (zero), missing image alt attrs (zero), BreadcrumbList JSON-LD URL inconsistency (zero post-Session-12-fixes).

**AMS Event Rentals backlink upgrade (asks defined, not yet sent — Joseph knows them personally and is sending direct):**
- Tier 1 asks: dedicated `/flextram` page on amseventrentals.com (vs current logo-row link) with 300–500 words; varied anchor text using "event tram rental," "festival shuttle service," "stadium parking shuttle," "FlexTrolley" (the position-65–80 term that body-text alone hasn't moved); deep-link to solution pages not just homepage.
- Tier 2: internal links to that page from their main rentals + footer; co-authored neutral blog post; add FlexTram to their service catalog as a named offering ("Event Trams powered by FlexTram").
- Tier 3 non-SEO: formalize lead-share, joint quote, LinkedIn cross-posts.

**Followups for next session:**
- **Submit GSC reindex on `https://www.flextram.com/solutions/`** — the corrected ItemList structured data propagates fastest if the hub URL is manually requested (Google rebuilds the structured-data graph for all 19 child URLs from there).
- **Re-check `/solutions/airport-fbo` engagement on or after 2026-04-24** — current 3s/1s data is pre-recrawl (visitors arrived via OLD search snippets). Need to wait for Google to recrawl + serve new vocab snippets + new visitors to land before validating the FBO-vocabulary rewrite hypothesis.

### Session 14 (2026-04-21) — Second manifesto post, cross-link cluster, GSC breakthrough response, 31-page meta description sweep

Morning session. Clean output-to-leverage ratio — shipped new content, closed the deferred long-tail TODO from Session 13, and caught two separate data signals (one inbound traffic breakthrough, one stale-capacity straggler from 2026-04).

**Content published:**
- **"Systems Over Units: Why Smaller Vehicles Don't Solve Bigger Crowd Problems"** (`/blog/systems-over-units`, ~2,000 words, Industry). Introduces the predictable-flow vs. unpredictable-flow decision framework. Thesis: micro-mobility succeeds in cities because urban flow is unpredictable (units serve individuals); it fails at venues because venue flow is predictable (systems serve corridors). Extends the argument forward to autonomous vehicles — even self-driving pods inside a venue repeat the same mistake as golf carts when the corridor is bottlenecked.
- **Structurally pairs with Session 13's "Cities Solved This"** as a two-part argument. Cities established THAT urban transit principles apply at venue scale; Systems-Over-Units establishes the decision rule FOR applying them. Reading them in order is a genuine foundation-plus-framework sequence.
- Hero: empty-plaza stadium (Gazprom Arena) with scattered e-scooter riders — visual metaphor for the units-in-a-large-venue failure mode. Buried position 1 in "More articles" grid (the two-post cluster occupies the top).
- Full SEO stack: BlogPosting + FAQPage + BreadcrumbList + Organization JSON-LD, OG/Twitter, canonical, 5 FAQs, related-reading cluster (cities-solved-this, why-isnt-transportation-assumed, onsite-transportation-paradigm, stadiums-arenas). Sitemap priority 0.7.

**Reciprocal cross-links between cities-solved-this ↔ systems-over-units:**
- Yesterday's post linked forward only one direction (systems → cities via "transit planners arrived at a century ago" inline anchor). Today added the reverse:
  - **Inline anchor** in cities-solved-this: "There's no coordination, no consolidation, <a>no system</a>" — "no system" becomes the anchor text pointing to the destination article's core concept. Contextual inline anchor text passes more link authority than grid cards.
  - **Related Reading card** added as the first card in the cities-solved-this grid.
- Net: both posts now point to each other through two link surfaces each. Google/AI crawlers will see them as a tightly clustered pair on the same topic — which builds topical authority faster than a single isolated post on the same subject.

**GSC breakthrough signal + fast response:**
- **`/blog/stadium-districts-mixed-use-transportation.html` went 3 → 152 impressions in a single week** (50x). Queries driving the spike:
  - "stadium mobility infrastructure" (9 imps, up from 0)
  - "stadium transportation hub connectivity" (3 imps, up from 0)
  - "denver broncos inurl:blog" (0 imps this week, 2 last week — AI-operator query pattern; same signature as the Session 8 `-site:reddit.com` data-center surface)
- **Key insight:** these aren't fan queries — they're B2B research vocabulary (consultant / architect / venue-planner terminology). The post is ranking because its body references Carrie Walton Penner (Broncos), HOK, Burns & McDonnell, JLL, Brad Chambers — professional research context, not casual content. Google is sending the post to the audience whose vocabulary it shares.
- **`.html` version is the one ranking, not the canonical pretty URL.** Historical indexing signals and backlinks anchor the `.html` version. The Session 13 canonical fix (ItemList → pretty URL) applies here too; expect consolidation to the pretty URL over 2–3 weeks as Google re-processes the structured-data graph.
- **Action shipped:** added "stadium mobility infrastructure" and "stadium transportation hub connectivity" to meta keywords on 5 adjacent stadium-cluster pages to try to pull the same research-query traffic across solution pages (the conversion surface) not just blog posts (the discovery surface):
  - `solutions/stadiums-arenas`, `solutions/football-stadiums`
  - `blog/courtesy-shuttle-load-bearing`, `blog/football-parking-lot-weakest-link`, `blog/hidden-cost-of-making-fans-walk`
- **Honest caveat documented in the commit:** Google deprecated `<meta name="keywords">` as a ranking signal in 2009. Bing still uses it lightly, and AI crawlers (Gemini/Perplexity/ChatGPT) scrape it as retrieval context. Real signal needs body-copy presence of these phrases, not just meta — but meta is the free free-keywords declaration. Watch over 2–4 weeks: if only the blog post still ranks for these queries and the 5 tagged pages don't surface, the fix is body-copy edits on the solution pages, not another meta pass.

**Meta description long-tail sweep — 31 pages tightened to SERP-safe lengths (the Session 13 deferred TODO, closed):**
- Every page's meta description was ≤160 chars before the sweep for 4 highest-traffic pages (Session 13). This session closed out the remaining 31 pages: 11 blog posts + 17 solution pages + 3 others (request-a-bid, landing-page, plus a couple of blog hub-level pages).
- Was: descriptions running 161–244 chars. Now: 134–158 chars. All under the ~155–160 char SERP truncation boundary.
- **Also synced og:description + twitter:description + JSON-LD BlogPosting.description** on 7 files where those fields had drifted into their own long wording. All four snippet-signal layers now agree per page → Google sees one consistent signal, not three different lengths.
- Voice preserved: blog posts keep their ranking hook as the opening sentence; solution pages keep their template rhythm ("FlexTram [does X] for [vertical]. One driver, up to 27 passengers. [Trait].")
- **Data consistency bonus find during the scan:** `solutions/healthcare-hospitals.html` meta description said "up to 25 patients" — stale from before the 25→27 capacity standardization in Session 2. Corrected. Two `25 total seats` body references verified as legitimate golf-cart comparison math (5 carts × 5 seats) and left intact.

**Three inbound leads closed (removed from TODOs):**
- **Pittsburgh Vintage Grand Prix (Ross Miller / EVP Partnerships)** — closed. Schenley Park event July 18–19, 2026. Opportunity: replace their 7-bus fleet (5 standard + 2 ADA) and add a Schenley Drive loop.
- **Hinterland Music Festival** (Saint Charles, IA, July 28–Aug 3) — closed. 16–32 trams for staff/BOH movement. Biggest single-deal inbound of the month.
- **Coachella "saw your trams" lead** — closed. Validated the on-tram branding opportunity that today's GSC research-query signal corroborates (sophisticated buyers noticing FlexTram at events and researching it afterwards).
- **All three removed from the high-priority TODO block.** Keeping them in Session 10/11 context for historical attribution (useful when trying to trace back which piece of content / campaign drove which deal 6 months from now).

**Followups for next session:**
- **`/blog/systems-over-units` + reciprocal-link cities-solved-this** — both should get a GSC URL Inspection → Request Indexing so the cross-link graph propagates cleanly.
- **Watch the 5 keyword-tagged stadium pages in GSC queries report** (2–4 week horizon) — are they starting to pull the "stadium mobility infrastructure" / "stadium transportation hub connectivity" traffic, or is only the stadium-districts post still ranking? If the latter, next move is body-copy edits on the solution pages (not another meta pass).
- **Watch if the stadium-districts .html → pretty-URL consolidation happens** over the next 2–3 weeks post-canonical-fix. Healthy signal: the pretty URL starts appearing in SERPs and the .html version drops. Unhealthy: both URLs persist (means Google is still seeing mixed signals somewhere).

### Session 15 (2026-04-22) — GA4 conversion funnel verdict, FBO post #2, workflow hardening, campus-asset positioning pattern

Full day. Three major threads.

**GA4 verdict on Session 11 CTA redesign + full conversion picture:**
- Built the CTA Type Explore (finally — data window opened today, 3 days post-custom-dimension-registration). Result: 3 cta_click events over 3 days, all on alt CTAs (2 bid_form + 1 calendly), all from body location. Translation: the Session 11 homepage redesign (outlined pill cards below the form) IS capturing alt-CTA clicks — hypothesis validated at the margin. Pattern right, volume modest (~1 click/day).
- Built CTA Location Explore — confirmed all 3 events came from `body` (most likely the homepage outlined pill cards specifically).
- Events report full pull exposed the actual conversion picture:
  - **3 form_submit_success / 3 users** (primary homepage contact form)
  - **1 bid_request_submit / 2 bid_request_received** (first bid funnel conversion since 4/17 launch; received > submit is likely thank-you-page refresh, not instrumentation bug)
  - **17 cta_click / 8 users** (alt-CTA interactions)
  - **form_visible 53 → form_submit_success 3 = 5.7% form conversion rate** (~2× B2B benchmark of 1–3%)
  - **4 documented conversions / 199 users / 28 days = 2% overall lead rate**
  - **Verdict:** The form is doing the heavy lifting at above-benchmark rates. Alt CTAs are appropriately sized as supplementary. **Don't iterate on CTA layout** — grow the top of funnel.
  - `form_submit` (6) and `form_field_focus` (2) are legacy Enhanced Measurement artifacts from pre-4/19 that'll fade as the 28-day window rolls past the disable date. Not bot signals.

**Traffic source diagnostic (new finding):**
- GA4 Session source/medium over the 28-day window: `google 59 / linkedin.com 7 / amseventrentals.com 6 / duckduckgo 1 / gemini.google.com 1`
- **LinkedIn at 7 attributed sessions** — real signal. Caveat: LinkedIn mobile-app shares strip referrer and land as `(direct) / (none)`, so actual LinkedIn-driven traffic is likely 2–3× this (~15–25 real sessions). Under-counted until UTM tagging starts.
- **AMS Event Rentals at 6 sessions from ONE existing backlink.** This is the bonus insight of the day — a single referral backlink is driving nearly as much traffic as the entire LinkedIn presence. Validates why the AMS backlink-upgrade asks matter so much; if Joseph lands the dedicated `/flextram` page + deep-links + varied anchor text, the 6 could become 20–50+.
- AI referrals (gemini.google.com) continuing — tiny (1 session) but the pattern is consistent since Session 8.

**UTM tagging adopted for future LinkedIn shares:**
- Joseph will now tag every LinkedIn share going forward with `?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=POST_SLUG`. This captures mobile-app clicks that currently land as direct — expected to surface the hidden 2–3× LinkedIn traffic within 2–3 weeks of consistent tagging.
- Pre-UTM LinkedIn clicks are lost to attribution permanently (they're stuck as `(direct)`). Going forward only.

**Content published:**
- **"You Don't Know Who's Driving on Your Property. Neither Does Your Insurance Company."** (`/blog/fleet-liability-insurance`, ~2,000 words, **Risk & Operations — new category**). CPSC NEISS injury data (15K ER visits/yr, 64% rise 2015–24, 300%+ claims rise, 75% of injuries are passengers), Florida "dangerous instrumentality" classification, pedicab liability under premises theory, City of Houston advisory, Arlington TX 2020 8-0 unanimous council vote to terminate program. Buried position 15 in grid, sitemap priority 0.5. Targets venue risk managers / event producers / insurance underwriters — a new buyer persona surface.

**Auto-publish workflow hardened (image-sitemap extension):**
- This morning's auto-publish of fan-experience-gap (April 22 scheduled post) fired on production before Joseph's manual fleet-liability-insurance push, causing the manual push to be rejected. Recovered via `git fetch production` → rebase → resolve sitemap.xml conflict → push both remotes (same pattern documented in Session 11's workflow-divergence recovery).
- **Caught during recovery:** the auto-publish workflow was adding sitemap entries WITHOUT `<image:image>` blocks, because the image-sitemap extension (shipped 2026-04-21) post-dated the workflow's last touch. Fixed same-day: workflow now transforms BLOG_META `image:` and `image_alt:` fields into absolute URLs + XML-escaped captions and emits the image:image block. Falls back gracefully (no block) if BLOG_META lacks image fields.
- Verified via Python-simulated sed output that the XML is well-formed. Next scheduled auto-publish (April 29 — Sponsorship's Untapped Frontier) will exercise the updated code path. If it succeeds, no further workflow touch required. If it fails, fallback is the manual sitemap patch in the same shape as today's fan-experience-gap fix (30 seconds).
- Also retroactively added image:image to fan-experience-gap's sitemap entry during the merge-conflict resolution so it doesn't ship with a structural regression.

**"Campus-resident asset" positioning pattern — 4-page rollout:**
- Inspired by a client prompt to look at TransLoc's on-demand-shuttle phrasing for the healthcare-hospitals page. Landed on a broader pattern: 4 solution pages (healthcare-hospitals, senior-living, planned-communities, resort-hotel) share a buyer mental model of *owning and operating campus assets* (hospital wing, retirement campus, community pool, hotel grounds). Re-framed FlexTram as "another asset that lives on your property and runs whatever pattern your team designs" instead of a contracted vendor service.
- **healthcare-hospitals (5 edits, yesterday)** — hero "lives on your campus" + new solution paragraph about peak/on-demand flexibility + pain card rewrite (contracted shuttles aren't there when you need them) + new "how is FlexTram operated" FAQ + fixed truncated existing FAQ.
- **senior-living (3 edits, today, MEDIUM intensity)** — hero tweak + new solution paragraph (meal-time loops, medical appointment runs, family visitor pickups, weather sweeps) + new operations FAQ. Deliberately preserved "predictable schedule" framing (resident consistency anxiety).
- **planned-communities (3 edits, today, MEDIUM intensity)** — hero "community-owned asset" framing + new solution paragraph (HOA as operating-model owner; weekend amenity loops, evening commerce loops, event mode, model home tours) + new operations FAQ.
- **resort-hotel (2 edits, today, LIGHT intensity)** — solution-block sentence add + new "special events / charters / off-loop pickups" FAQ. Preserved "continuous guest loop" as primary mode; positioned flex use cases as secondary.
- **Strategic tension preserved site-wide:** this change does NOT contradict the broader manifesto posts (cities-solved-this, systems-over-units) which argue fixed-route + posted-schedule is the right answer for predictable flow. Campus-resident-asset pages are legitimate hybrid contexts — predictable peaks + unpredictable off-peak — and the edits lean into "you choose the operating pattern" rather than "on-demand replaces fixed-route."
- Sitemap lastmod refreshed for all 4 pages to 2026-04-22 (were all stale at 2026-04-17 / 04-19). Joseph requested GSC indexing on all 4 URLs.

**What changes for next session:**
- **Rerun CTA Type Explore on or after 2026-04-29** (7+ days of forward data) for cleaner sample. 3-event baseline is real but small; 21+ events would tell us whether the redesign holds at higher traffic or if we're seeing a flukey first week.
- **April 29 auto-publish is the test case for the workflow image-sitemap patch.** If it emits an `<image:image>` block in the Sponsorship's Untapped Frontier sitemap entry on first try, celebrate and move on. If not, fall back to 30-sec manual patch.
- **Watch engagement time on the 4 "campus-resident asset" pages over 2–4 weeks.** If the new positioning resonates, engagement time rises on healthcare-hospitals, senior-living, planned-communities, resort-hotel. If no change, the positioning is invisible to traffic — which is also useful data (means top-of-funnel growth is the actual lever, not copy optimization).
- **Watch for new GSC query patterns from fleet-liability-insurance post.** Target B2B research vocabulary: "golf cart liability venue," "event premises liability," "dangerous instrumentality," "pedicab insurance requirements," "venue fleet risk management." Same pattern as stadium-districts breakthrough — different audience persona (risk managers, underwriters, event insurance brokers).

### Session 16 (2026-04-27) — Grand Openings vertical (blog + solution + cross-links), GA4 verdict on CTA redesign + airport-FBO vocab rewrite

**Content shipped (new vertical, full surface coverage):**

- **New blog post:** "You Spent $50 Million on the Facility. Spend Two Weeks on How Guests Move Through It." (`/blog/grand-opening-transportation`, ~2,000 words, **Grand Openings & Corporate Events — new category**). Hero photo from FlexTram's actual Ingredion Cedar Rapids deployment (real industrial site with trams visible in frame, Ingredion logo on silos in background). Source draft was reframed away from any implication that Ingredion's event had problems — Ingredion is positioned throughout as the positive proof point: "they extended the same operational thinking that goes into the facility itself to the experience of moving guests through it." Buried position 18 of 26 in More articles grid (sitemap priority 0.5, discovery-not-broadcast).
- **New solution page:** `/solutions/grand-openings` — the 20th vertical. Targets the corporate event / facility tour buyer surface for manufacturing, data centers, distribution, healthcare, corporate campuses. Solutions hub card inserted at position 14 of 20, between Factory & facility tours and Convention centers (natural VIP-tour-of-industrial-property cluster). ItemList JSON-LD updated 19 → 20 verticals, positions 14–20 renumbered. 500×500 hub thumbnail (square crop of Ingredion event photo, trams visible). Sitemap priority 0.8.
- **Reciprocal cross-links** between blog post and solution page — both surfaces now have first-position related-reading cards pointing to the other, so any visitor landing on either page has the most direct path to the conversion surface or the discovery surface (whichever they didn't enter on).
- **One factual fix during draft prep:** original draft claimed data center construction spending was "$41 billion in annualized capital in 2025" with no source. Web-verified — actual number is closer to ~$45B annualized rate by late 2025, with full-year 2025 expected to exceed $60B (ConstructConnect's January 2026 Data Center Report). Updated with citation.

**Structural + performance checks on the new pages (all clean):**
- Sitemap XML well-formed (xmllint clean), 50 URLs total
- All internal links resolve to real pages (no broken cross-links)
- Hero images have explicit width/height (CLS-safe)
- All images have alt text
- Asset sizes within budget: hero 114KB (1200px) + 37KB (640px), thumbnail 36KB
- Word counts healthy: blog 2,635 raw including markup (~2,000 visible), solution 1,172
- Related-card thumbnails missing width/height attrs — **pre-existing site pattern, not a regression** (matches factory-tours and other solution pages; lazy-loaded below-fold images, low CLS impact)

**GA4 mid-session pull — three verdicts in one snapshot (28-day window, Mar 30 – Apr 26):**

1. **CTA Type Explore — Session 11 homepage redesign verdict (the deferred Session 15 TODO, closed):**
   - 21 cta_click events, broken down: bid_form 3 (43% of post-4/19 data), calendly 2 (29%), contact_form 2 (29%), (not set) 14 (historical pre-4/19 data, permanently unsliceable)
   - **Reading:** the Session 11 outlined-pill-card redesign **is working**. Across ~8 days of clean data, alt CTAs (bid_form + calendly) account for **71% of CTA clicks**; contact_form is at 29%. Pre-redesign, contact_form was carrying ~100%. Material redistribution achieved.
   - **Slick = 0, email = 0** on the bid thank-you page — but that's because traffic isn't getting that deep yet, not a design problem. Need more bid submissions before drawing conclusions on tier-2 fallback CTAs.
   - **Decision:** stop iterating on the CTA layout. Pattern is right. Grow top-of-funnel instead.

2. **Airport-FBO vocabulary rewrite — hypothesis test (Session 11 work):**
   - `/solutions/airport-fbo.html` (.html, pre-rewrite traffic): 19 views / 9 users / **3s engagement**
   - `/solutions/airport-fbo` (canonical pretty URL, post-rewrite traffic): 15 views / 12 users / **8s engagement**
   - **2.7× engagement improvement on the canonical URL** vs. the .html version. Not the 10s+ stretch target, but pattern matches hypothesis. .html is pulling traffic from old SERP snippets that still route there; pretty URL is getting new visitors landing on the rewritten copy.
   - **Decision:** soft-positive. Don't iterate again. Wait 2–3 weeks for Google to fully consolidate the .html → pretty URL traffic (Session 13's canonical fix), then re-pull. The 3s number should fade and the 8s should be the only signal.

3. **Conversion picture (28 days):**
   - 392 sessions / 270 users / 9 key events
   - **Lead rate: 3.33%** (up from Session 15's 2.0%) — well above 1–2% B2B benchmark
   - 8 of 9 key events from homepage (88.89%); 1 from /request-a-bid (the Wakefern bid 4/23 — first bid-funnel conversion since 4/17 launch)
   - 0 direct conversions from any solution or blog page (form_submit_success only fires on homepage form — by design)
   - Form funnel: form_visible 82 → form_start 6 → form_submit_success 3 (3.7% form-to-conversion, ~2× B2B benchmark)

**Traffic acquisition snapshot (28 days):**
- Direct: 294 sessions (75%) / 28% engagement / 15s — inflated by LinkedIn mobile-app pre-UTM
- Organic Search: 75 (19%) / **69% engagement / 47s** — highest quality channel by every metric
- Organic Social: 14 (4%) / 86% engagement / 41s — tiny but excellent quality (this category is now appearing as a separate channel, was previously in unassigned/direct)
- Referral: 8 (2%) / 63% / 51s — mostly AMS Event Rentals
- Unassigned: 2 / 0% / 3s — bots/edge cases

**The AMS Event Rentals signal is now provable as high-leverage:** 8 referral sessions converted 2 key events = 25% session-to-key-event ratio, the best of any channel. The Tier 1 backlink-upgrade asks (dedicated /flextram page, varied anchor text including FlexTrolley term, deep-links to solution pages) are now empirically high-ROI. Joseph sending direct.

**Snapshot growth vs. Session 15:**
- Sessions 246 → 392 (+59%)
- Users 167 → 270 (+62%)
- Key events 4 → 9 (+125%)
- Lead rate 2.0% → 3.33% (improving as funnel matures)

**What the data says about next-session priorities:**
- **Top of funnel is the lever, not conversion-rate optimization.** The funnel works (3.33% lead rate is healthy). More content + more backlinks + more LinkedIn = more conversions.
- **AMS backlink upgrade has highest expected ROI.** A single existing backlink is driving 25% conversion rate. Multiplying or improving that backlink is leverage.
- **LinkedIn UTM tagging needs 2–3 more weeks** to surface hidden mobile-app traffic out of the (direct) bucket.
- **Don't iterate the homepage.** The CTA redesign verdict is in. The form is converting at 2× B2B benchmark.

**Tier 1 site audit (post-Grand Openings ship):**
- **Sitemap reachability:** all 50 production URLs return 200. Clean.
- **Broken-link audit:** 1,343 internal links across 62 HTML files → 0 broken in production (11 broken were all in `_source_files/` which doesn't deploy). Clean.
- **Lighthouse mobile (warm-cache run, Lighthouse 12.8.2 against production):**
  - `/blog/grand-opening-transportation` — Perf **78**, A11y **100**, BP **100**, SEO **100** | LCP 1.8s ✓ | TBT **860ms ✗** | CLS 0.005 ✓ | SI 2.1s ✓
  - `/solutions/grand-openings` — Perf **93**, A11y **100**, BP **100**, SEO **100** | LCP 2.6s ~ | TBT 0ms ✓ | CLS 0.01 ✓ | SI 2.6s ✓
  - Solution page matches site baseline. Blog post is 22 points below — TBT 860ms is the killer (target <200ms). Render-blocking work + main-thread cost on the longer article body. Top opportunities for both pages: "Properly size images" (~360ms) + "Serve images in next-gen formats" (WebP) (~330ms).
  - **Both pages score 100 on Accessibility + Best Practices + SEO.** Crucially: `unsized-images` and `color-contrast` audits do NOT fail on these pages — invalidates the two follow-up TODOs that were originally drafted from speculative audit data. Logo nav `<img>` lacking width/height attrs and orange CTA contrast both already pass real Lighthouse audits. Closed both TODOs without any code change.
  - **Cold-cache run anomaly to remember:** first Lighthouse run of a session (cold http.server cache) can show wildly inflated TBT and Speed Index (saw Perf 31 / TBT 3,120ms / SI 29.6s on first blog run, then Perf 88–92 on warm runs of the exact same page). Always run a curl warmup pass first or run audits in pairs and use the second number. Discovered 2026-04-27.
- **Pre-existing site-wide flags surfaced (not introduced by today's pages, queued as follow-ups):**
  1. **Nav logo `<img>` missing explicit `width`/`height` attrs** site-wide. Inline `style="height: 30px"` sets visual height but Lighthouse wants HTML attributes. Pattern: `<img src="../assets/img/logo_black_new.png" alt="FlexTram" style="height: 30px;">` on ~45 pages. Minimal real-world CLS impact (height is fixed inline) but Lighthouse `unsized-images` audit fails. Fix: add `width="..." height="30"` (logo native dimensions).
  2. **Color contrast failure on orange CTA buttons** site-wide (`.nav-cta`, `.btn-primary`, `.sticky-cta`). Orange-on-white doesn't meet WCAG AA 4.5:1 contrast for normal-size text. Fix: darken the orange a notch, or bump CTA font-size into the "large text" 3:1 threshold range.
- **Toolchain note:** Node.js was reinstalled today via `brew install node` after a 2018-era manual install left two root-owned directories blocking Homebrew's symlinks (`/usr/local/include/node`, `/usr/local/share/doc/node`). Resolved with `sudo rm -rf` of the leftovers + `brew link --overwrite node` + `npm install -g lighthouse` + manual symlinks from `/usr/local/Cellar/node/25.9.0_2/bin/` into `/usr/local/bin/`. Node 25.9.0 + Lighthouse 13.1.0 now available for future audits.

### Session 17 (2026-04-27 continued) — FSU testimonial live + WebP site-wide + FSU-vocab keyword sweep

Afternoon continuation of Session 16. Three concrete shipments, each compounding the next.

**Sitemap lastmod refresh:**
- Morning's site-wide a11y commit (`2543493`, Session 16) touched essentially every HTML page in the sitemap (all 19 solution pages + every blog post + index.html + request-a-bid + the blog/solutions hubs + 404). Bumped all 50 sitemap entries to lastmod `2026-04-27` in one pass (`d6d564a`). Tells Google to recrawl the structural-SEO surface.

**FSU testimonial — first real testimonial on the site, closes Session 5 TODO:**
- Kari Terezakis (EVP, Seminole Boosters · Florida State University) provided a 5-sentence quote on FlexTram's gameday parking operations. Joseph confirmed full-attribution usage rights this afternoon.
- Built `.testimonial-block` component: italic body, orange (#c44323) Georgia opening quote mark, bold attribution name, top/bottom 1px borders, mobile-responsive (1.15rem on <640px). Lives in `assets/css/global.css` for solution pages; identical CSS inlined in homepage critical CSS block since homepage uses Bootstrap+custom.css stack (no global.css dependency).
- Placed on **4 pages** following the "testimonial right before the CTA block as conversion closer" pattern:
  - `index.html` — between client-logos slick carousel and contact form (replaced the 150px spacer)
  - `solutions/football-stadiums.html` — exact-match vertical (quote literally says "football gameday parking operations"), between FAQ list and CTA
  - `solutions/stadiums-arenas.html` — broader stadium audience, between related-reading and CTA
  - `solutions/university-campus.html` — collegiate athletics buyer surface, between FAQ and CTA
- Verified rendering at desktop 1280px and mobile 375px; no console errors; preview screenshot pass clean. (`b4f0121`)
- **Strategic unlock:** the testimonial closes a Session 5 TODO that's been open ~3 weeks. Now positions FlexTram for the Power 4 booster outreach play (Kari as both quote source AND reference for other athletics programs) once Joseph requests permission for the reference role specifically.

**FSU-vocab keyword sweep (5 pages, signal-layer alignment):**
- Kari's quote uses "gameday parking operations" and "data-driven solutions adaptable to our evolving needs" — both are exact phrases buyers search internally.
- Added `gameday parking operations` + `data-driven shuttle operations` to meta keywords on:
  - `solutions/stadiums-arenas` — also added `collegiate athletics shuttle`
  - `solutions/football-stadiums` — also added `P4 athletics shuttle`, `collegiate athletics shuttle`
  - `solutions/fifa-world-cup` — used `matchday parking operations` (closer to football/soccer vocab)
  - `solutions/raceways-motorsports` — used `race day parking operations`
  - `solutions/university-campus` — added `collegiate athletics shuttle`, `P4 athletics shuttle`
- **Body copy already carries these phrases site-wide** through the testimonial we placed earlier; the keyword sweep just aligns the meta-declaration layer with body. Same caveat as Session 14 stadium-mobility-infrastructure pattern: meta keywords aren't a Google ranking signal since 2009 — real lever is body text + backlinks. But meta is the free declaration layer that Bing + AI crawlers (Gemini/Perplexity/ChatGPT) scrape as retrieval context. Watch over 2–4 weeks for these terms surfacing in GSC.

**WebP hero conversion — site-wide perf shipment (closes Session 16 follow-up TODO):**
- Used Python PIL (already installed; sips on this Mac doesn't write WebP, brew formula `webp` not installed but unnecessary) to convert all hero images at quality 80, method 6.
- **86 new WebP files generated:** 40 × 1200px hero variants + 38 × 640px mobile hero variants + 6 × event-photo variants (3 homepage event photos × 2 sizes). Plus the bare `hero-poster.webp` for completeness (homepage video uses `poster=` attribute which can't take a `<picture>` so the .jpg stays in service there).
- **Total bytes: 14.2MB → 6.2MB across the 86 variants. 56.8% reduction.** Per-page hero-image weight dropped from typical 150–300KB JPG to 50–150KB WebP.
- HTML transformation (Python regex pass over 44 HTML files):
  - Wrapped each hero `<img class="hero-image">` (solution pages) and `<img class="post-hero">` (blog pages) in a `<picture>` element with WebP `<source>` + JPG `<img>` fallback. Modern browsers fetch WebP; the JPG `srcset` remains as fallback for any browser without WebP support (vanishingly few in 2026).
  - Updated each `<link rel="preload" as="image">` hint to `type="image/webp"` + WebP href, so modern browsers preload the smaller variant directly. Browsers without WebP skip the typed preload and fall back to the `<picture>` JPG.
  - 2 blog posts (`fan-experience-gap`, `onsite-transportation-paradigm`) and the homepage use event photos (`hero_lvfg`, `coachella_stagecoach`, `flextram_event3`) instead of `hero-` prefix files; treated separately in a follow-up edit pass.
- **Lighthouse mobile validation (5 pages, single warm runs each):**
  - `/blog/grand-opening-transportation`: **78 → 93–99** (+15–21, the Session 16 TBT regression target — TBT 860ms → 0–290ms across two runs)
  - `/blog/stadium-districts-mixed-use-transportation`: **76 → 96** (+20, Session 16's worst blog post)
  - `/solutions/airport-fbo`: **88 → 99** (+11, hit ceiling)
  - `/solutions/stadiums-arenas`: 90 → 88 (−2, within typical single-run variance)
  - `/` (homepage): ~45 → 48 (+3, still video-bound — 2.3MB hero video + Slick + Bootstrap stack is the unchanged ceiling per Session 10)
  - Pattern: **wherever there was room (heavy hero images dominating perf budget), perf jumped 11–20 points.** No regressions. The Session 16 blog template TBT regression hypothesis is closed — heavy JPG hero decoding on long article bodies WAS the long task. (`bf55be4`)
- **OG/Twitter `meta` images + JSON-LD `image` references kept as JPG.** Some social platforms (LinkedIn, older WhatsApp, iMessage) don't reliably preview WebP. The branded `og-flextram-v1.jpg` and per-page hero JPGs continue to serve link previews while the on-page render uses WebP.

**Homepage CLS regression flagged for next session:**
- Homepage CLS measured at **0.223** in today's run — well above the 0.1 Google ranking threshold and a regression from the site-wide <0.1 we hit in Session 10. Likely cause: late-loading hero video + Slick carousel reflow or contact-alt-cards loading after layout. Single-run noise caveat applies (need a 3-run median before treating 0.223 as the real number) but even at half that, it's still above threshold. Worth diagnosing on a future pass — not urgent because `/` already ranks position 1.06 for "flextram" (no organic-traffic blocker), but it's an active Core Web Vitals signal that didn't exist a sprint ago.

### Session 18 (2026-04-28) — Cruise destination transit blog post + new vertical opens

Short focused session. One major shipment: a ~2,400-word blog post that opens a brand-new vertical (cruise lines' owned destinations — CocoCay, Celebration Key, Half Moon Cay, Castaway Cay, etc.).

**Content shipped:**
- **"You Built the Island. You Built the Beach Club. You Built the Waterpark. Who Built the Ride Between Them?"** (`/blog/cruise-destination-transit`, ~2,400 words, **Cruise Destinations & Port Operations — new category**)
- **Strategic angle:** Royal Caribbean and Carnival have already validated the concept — both run complimentary tram services at their flagship owned destinations (CocoCay every 15 min, Celebration Key continuous hop-on/hop-off with two lagoon loops at 5-min headway, Sensory Inclusive certification). The post reframes the question: it's not whether tram service belongs at owned cruise destinations (proven), it's whether the systems running today are operating at their full potential — purpose-built routes, peak-demand scheduling for two-ship days, branded experience integration, and integrated ADA service rather than a parallel option.
- **Operational model differentiator:** unlike event deployments (vehicles travel to site, operate, return), owned cruise destinations are the first FlexTram use case where the equipment lives onsite permanently — stored in a maintenance shed on the island, operated by local destination crew (the same team running beach bars, excursion desks, retail). Three benefits: predictable local labor cost, skilled local employment in Bahamas/Haiti/Caribbean communities (matters for cruise lines' community relations narratives), and the system becomes operationally invisible to the ship — like the pool or the restaurant, just another destination amenity.
- **Closing argument:** standardize a single tram platform across both environments (homeports + owned destinations) for end-to-end guest experience consistency. Pairs structurally with `/blog/cruise-terminals-people-moving` from earlier in the year.
- **5 sourced citations:** Royal Caribbean (CocoCay), TravelAge West / Carnival (Celebration Key build details), Cruise Hive (CocoCay tram guide), Carnival FAQ (Celebration Key trams), EatSleepCruise, Professor Melissa Cruises (visitor tip on tram station). All inline with `target="_blank" rel="noopener"` per Session 13 standard.
- **5 FAQs:** owned destination tram need; concept validation at CocoCay/Celebration Key; how cruise destination differs from event deployment (stored onsite vs mobilized); local crew model; one-platform integration with homeports.
- Hero image: Celebrity Beyond cruise ship docked at a Caribbean port (1200×900 JPG + WebP, 640×480 mobile variants — 4 total image files). 207KB JPG / 132KB WebP at full size; 65KB JPG / 44KB WebP at mobile. WebP variants generated alongside JPG per Session 17 site-wide pattern.
- **Positioning in blog grid:** position 1 of "More articles" (top of grid; flagship "Why Isn't Transportation on the List?" manifesto retains Featured slot per Session 14 manifesto-priority discipline). Sitemap priority 0.7 — solid industry analysis tier matching `systems-over-units` and `cities-solved-this`. Not buried discovery (0.5) because cruise lines aren't lurking in our content reading body language; they need direct outreach signals.
- **Reciprocal cross-linking:** added a related-reading card in `/blog/cruise-terminals-people-moving` pointing to the new post (now 4 cards total in that section). New post's own related-reading grid points back to cruise-terminals + `/solutions/cruise-terminals` + `/blog/curb-to-gate-fan-journey` (end-to-end fan journey design philosophy parallel) + `/blog/turnkey-mass-transit` (the "stored onsite, run by local crew" deployment-model parallel).
- (`d69d702`)

**What this unlocks:**
- **Cold outreach to cruise line strategy/destination teams** with a credible content asset that already names them (Royal Caribbean, Carnival, MSC, Disney). The post gives Joseph a "you might find this interesting" link to attach to introduction emails to: Royal Caribbean Group destination operations, Carnival Cruise Line guest experience team, MSC Ocean Cay operations, Disney Cruise Line (Castaway Cay + Lighthouse Point under construction), Norwegian Cruise Line (Great Stirrup Cay).
- **Differentiator from any one-off equipment vendor:** the operational model (onsite storage + local crew + standardize across homeport+destination) is a system-design pitch, not a procurement RFP response. That's the FlexTram thesis applied to a vertical that was previously under-covered.
- **Pairs with cruise-terminals as a 2-piece content cluster.** Together: the homeport turnaround day (existing) + the destination day (new) = end-to-end cruise-line onsite transit story. Total ~4,500 words across the cluster, multiple internal links both directions.

### Session 19 (2026-04-28 continued + 2026-04-29) — Where We Operate page, gated procurement-packet funnel, CTA nomenclature standardization, "The Pattern" blog post, full link-graph rebuild

Long multi-day session. Five major shipments + a process improvement.

**1. Site hygiene scan (clean):**
- Audited 55 production HTML files. 0 broken internal links, 0 missing alt tags, all "25 passenger" references verified as legitimate golf-cart comparison math (5 carts × 5 passengers = 25 vs FlexTram's 27 — Session 14 had already cleared this), all date references intentional (forward projections, historical), footer copyright dynamic-year via JS. No fixes needed.

**2. /where-we-operate service-area page (commit `e107f9a` → `76bbd92` → `d0e89f7`):**
- Built a lean informational page that heads off the recurring "are you available in [X]?" qualifying inquiry (Live Nation Canada was a lost-deal signal in earlier sessions; multiple state-specific availability questions had come in).
- **Coverage statement explicit:** US + Canada throughout. International beyond is case-by-case.
- Initial build had a 6-region grid naming specific clients (Coachella, Bonnaroo, FSU, Wakefern, PVGP, NASCAR, Ingredion) — Joseph correctly pushed back on disclosing the named-account list publicly while the moat is still being built. Removed the section. Page now flows: hero → "How deployment works" (event vs permanent-storage operating models) → 5 FAQs → CTA. Coverage stays explicit; client list stays private.
- H1 simplified from "Where we operate. *Throughout the United States and Canada.*" (italic-split) to "We operate throughout the United States and Canada." (single-style, single-sentence) per Joseph's feedback.
- Sitemap priority 0.6 (informational utility — between blog 0.5 and solution 0.7). Structured data: BreadcrumbList + Organization with `areaServed: [US, Canada]` + FAQPage JSON-LD. Inbound links from homepage contact section ("Deploying across the United States and Canada" with link) and `/request-a-bid` intro.

**3. Gated procurement-packet funnel — architectural decision + build (commits `a45c276`, `565ce44`):**
- **Architectural debate:** my initial proposal was an open `/for-procurement` resources page with insurance/safety/spec details visible. Joseph correctly flagged the moat concern: publishing procurement-grade collateral openly removes the qualifying touchpoint AND hands competitors a parity checklist while the moat is still being built. Pivoted to a **gated lead-capture page** that signals "we have what procurement teams need" without disclosing the actual specs, captures a qualifying form, and routes to a Joseph-controlled tailored response.
- **`/procurement-packet`** built (5-required-field form: name, work email, organization, role-optional, project type, timeline + free-text notes). Hidden field `source=procurement_packet` for GA4 segmentation. Submit posts to existing Formspree endpoint, redirects to `/procurement-packet-received` thank-you page.
- Public page lists *categorically* what's in the packet (vehicle specs, ADA compliance, COI on request, deployment SOPs, operating-model options, reference list — provided after qualification) without disclosing any of it. Italic note explicitly frames the response as "tailored to the project — not a one-size-fits-all download" so buyers expect a personal email, not an auto-attached PDF.
- **Thank-you page** noindex,follow per the bid-form pattern. Sets the "one business day, tailored response" expectation. Three secondary cards (product overview slick / Calendly / "ready to formalize? bid form").
- **GA4 instrumentation:** `procurement_packet_submit` (form submit) + `procurement_packet_received` (thank-you arrival, conversion event) + `cta_click` with `cta_location` parameters. **Mark `procurement_packet_received` as Key Event in GA4 Admin** once it starts firing — same pattern as `bid_request_received` from Session 12.
- Sitemap priority 0.8 (lead capture surface, between bid form 0.9 and where-we-operate 0.6).
- **Inbound link** added to `/request-a-bid` intro lead paragraph: "Still evaluating vendors and need procurement-grade documentation first? Request the procurement packet." Skipped homepage card — would create 3-CTA decision paralysis with the existing bid-form/Calendly cards. Procurement buyers more naturally land via `/request-a-bid` or organic search.
- **Bid-form lead-paragraph link styling fix** — `.bid-hero .lead a` had no visible styling (inline links inheriting body color, no underline). Added brand-orange + 1px underline at 3px offset; hover darkens + thickens. Also bumped `bid-request.css` to `?v=2` cache-bust across the 4 files referencing it (returning visitors with old cached CSS would otherwise see stale styles).

**4. CTA nomenclature standardization site-wide (commit `6414fbb`):**
- **Audit found 6+ different verbs pointing at the homepage contact form alone** ("Check Availability" nav / "Request Info" sticky / "Request Quote" submit / "Tell us about your venue" form heading / "Let's talk!" body / "Request a formal bid" alt-card). Buyers had to mentally decode whether labels mapped to the same destination. Best-practice principle violated: same destination → same label.
- **Architecture left alone** (Session 11 alt-card pattern preserved, 3-persona separation preserved). This was pure label cleanup. **245 replacements across 55 HTML files** in the bulk pass + 5 straggler fixes for instances using non-standard selectors (homepage nav inline-style, solutions hub `cta-btn` class, where-we-operate page).
- **Final mapping (1 verb per destination):**
  - Homepage contact form: nav pill + sticky + all inner-page CTAs → **"Get in Touch"**; submit button → **"Send Message"**
  - `/request-a-bid`: card + inline → **"Request a Bid"**; submit → **"Submit Bid Request"**
  - `/procurement-packet`: inline + submit → **"Request the Packet"**
  - Calendly: **"Book a 30-min call"**
- **Honest tradeoff:** changed homepage submit from "Request Quote" → "Send Message" — deliberately retired Session 10's buyer-language work. Reasoning: "Request Quote" was competing with "Request a Bid" and "Request the Packet"; quote-stage buyers should land on `/request-a-bid` (which captures structured data the homepage form doesn't). The homepage is now unambiguously the casual/exploratory path. **Watch GA4 `source` field segmentation over 2–3 weeks** to confirm quote-intent traffic moves into the better-instrumented bid funnel as predicted. If volume to bid form goes up and homepage-form quote-intent goes down, the structural change worked. If bid-form volume drops, reconsider.

**5. "The Pattern" blog post (commit `c66689a` after rebase):**
- **"Coachella. The Kentucky Derby. The Super Bowl. F1. They All Have the Same Problem."** (`/blog/the-pattern`, ~2,250 words, **Industry Analysis**). Synthesizes 5 named events with 6 sourced citations into a single thesis: the same transportation-failure pattern repeats because the event was designed but the transportation wasn't.
- Cited events (with sources): Coachella 2025 12-hour traffic chaos / La Quinta City Council apology (KESQ); Kentucky Derby 812 private jets at Atlantic Aviation LOU (Business Jet Traveler); Super Bowl LX 1,000+ jets / 600 next-day departures / Hayward overflow (GlobalAir/WINGX); F1 USGP COTA shuttle disappearance (Ticketmaster reviews); Arlington TX 8-0 council vote banning pedicabs (CBS Texas).
- **Synthesis hub** for 5 prior FlexTram pieces: `why-isnt-transportation-assumed`, `systems-over-units`, `fleet-liability-insurance`, `cities-solved-this`, `curb-to-gate-fan-journey`. Position 1 of "More articles" grid (cruise-destination-transit bumped to position 2). Sitemap priority 0.7.
- Hero: festival crowd photo (1200×800 JPG + WebP + 640px mobile variants). 5 FAQs with FAQPage JSON-LD.
- **Shipped on April 29 — same day as the auto-publish workflow fired** for "Sponsorship's Untapped Frontier." Production push was rejected (auto-publish landed first). Recovered via the documented Session 11/15 pattern: `git fetch production` → rebase → resolve sitemap.xml conflict (kept both posts) → push production → force-with-lease origin.
- **April 29 auto-publish workflow image-sitemap patch validated.** "Sponsorship's Untapped Frontier" auto-published with a proper `<image:image>` block in its sitemap entry. The patch shipped 2026-04-22 worked on its first scheduled run. No manual sitemap fix-up required for that piece.

**6. Internal-link audit — orphans 11 → 5 → 0 across 2 passes (commits `0a07b2c`, `394980a`):**
- Audit identified 11 orphan posts (zero inbound blog→blog links) and 41 asymmetric pairs after publishing today's content. **The new pieces consistently launched as orphans** (the-pattern, sponsorship-untapped-frontier, grand-opening-transportation, cruise-destination-transit) because we'd been adding outbound links from new posts but not adding inbound from existing ones. Diagnosed and fixed in two passes.
- **Pass 1: 11 inline cross-link edits across 7 host files.** Inbound to the-pattern from why-isnt-transportation-assumed, systems-over-units, festival-season-here, world-cup-fan-first-mobility, football-parking-lot-weakest-link, fleet-liability-insurance. Plus rescues for hidden-cost-of-making-fans-walk, golf-tournament-spectator-experience, world-cup-fan-first-mobility, f1-fan-transportation, sponsorship-untapped-frontier. Result: orphans 11 → 5; the-pattern from 0 → 6 inbound (3rd-most-linked post).
- **Pass 2: 5 more inline cross-link edits.** Rescued the remaining orphans (fbo-ground-transportation, grand-opening-transportation, parking-lot-mobility-origin, venue-isnt-a-stadium, we-created-the-category). Result: **orphans 5 → 0.** Every blog post on the site now has at least 1 inbound blog→blog link.
- **Total link-graph delta:** 16 inline cross-links added, 12 host files touched. Manifesto cluster (why-isnt-transportation-assumed + systems-over-units + cities-solved-this + onsite-transportation-paradigm) is denser, the-pattern operates as a documented synthesis hub, and four older orphan pieces (golf-tournament, f1-fan, world-cup, hidden-cost) are pulled into their natural clusters.
- **Process improvement going forward:** when publishing a new blog post, **add 1–2 inbound links from existing pieces in the natural cluster as part of the same commit.** Avoids the orphan-on-publish pattern that triggered both audit passes today. This is now a publish-workflow rule, not a periodic-audit rule.

### Session 20 (2026-05-09 + 2026-05-10) — Mega-resort transit blog post, blog architecture strategy convo, worktree push pattern, Lighthouse audit

**Architectural conversation parked (blog hub bloat):**
- Joseph raised the question of whether to "remix" old posts or set up an archive to keep the hub from feeling bloated. Pushed back: at ~27 posts the bloat anxiety is real but the data doesn't show it — most blog traffic lands on individual posts via organic search, not the hub, so the hub-aesthetics problem is smaller than it feels. Also flagged the real risk: an "archive" section that hides posts from primary nav reduces link equity flowing to them from the hub, which would hurt exactly the kind of posts that quietly rank on B2B research vocabulary (e.g., stadium-districts 3 → 152 imps in Session 14). Suggested three lighter patterns in order of effort: (1) category/topic filters on the existing hub, (2) pillar pages at ~40 posts as evergreen topic hubs, (3) deliberate synthesis remixes (like the-pattern). Joseph parked the question. Revisit if/when post count approaches 40 or if hub-aesthetics anxiety returns.

**Content shipped — "Your Resort Has 2,888 Rooms, 15 Restaurants, and a Waterpark. Nobody Planned How Guests Move Between Them."** (`/blog/mega-resort-transit`, ~2,200 words, **Resorts & Hospitality — new category**, sitemap priority 0.7, position 1 of "More articles" grid):
- Anchor narrative: Gaylord Opryland 4-hour-walk anecdote + the $20/day wheelchair / $50/day scooter rental as a confession that the property is too large for unassisted walking.
- Portfolio framing names the named-asset opportunity surface: Gaylord Hotels 6 properties (Opryland, Palms, Texan, National, Rockies, Pacific), Atlantis Paradise Island (154 acres), Dorado Beach Ritz-Carlton Reserve (1,400 acres), The Broadmoor (5,000 acres), Ritz-Carlton Kapalua (54 acres in a 23,000-acre community).
- Reactive-solutions section: catalogs wheelchair/scooter rentals, golf-cart-on-request, bell-attendant escorts, courtesy shuttles to external destinations — each one a confession of the problem, none a system.
- "The convention guest has it worst" angle hands the post a B2B buyer surface (convention planners, meeting & event sales teams at Ryman/Marriott/Hilton) that the leisure-only angle misses.
- ADA section: 61M Americans / 1 in 7 mobility impaired / adults 65+ six times more likely framing. Argues the wheelchair rental addresses mobility but not experience — the missing layer is integrated transit that includes ADA service as standard, not parallel.
- "Portfolio opportunity" pitch directly to Ryman/Marriott/Hilton: standardized onsite transit across a multi-property hospitality brand is a brand-level differentiator, the same logic that gave branded networks consistent breakfast, gym, wifi.
- 6 sourced citations (PullOverAndLetMeOut blog, WBENC Gaylord Accessibility Guide, TakeTravelInfo, Wikipedia Atlantis, Rachel Harrison Communications x2, Booking.com Kapalua, Next Avenue/CDC, Rare Welsh Bit), all with `target="_blank" rel="noopener"`.
- 5 FAQs with FAQPage JSON-LD; full BlogPosting + BreadcrumbList + Organization JSON-LD; OG/Twitter meta; canonical; meta description tightened to 137 chars.

**Hero image generation workflow (Python PIL, repeatable pattern):**
- Source: `resort_blog_transit.jpg` (5393×3345 luxury beachfront aerial). Generated 4 variants in one script: 1200px JPG (quality 82, progressive) + 1200px WebP (quality 80, method 6) + 640px JPG + 640px WebP. Final sizes: 205KB / 166KB / 65KB / 54KB. Aspect ratio 1200×744 (natural from source, no letterbox class needed). Pattern from Session 17 WebP rollout; documented here as the standard new-post hero workflow.

**Cluster integration (Session 19 publish-workflow rule — inbound links in same commit):**
- Inbound from `properties-got-bigger.html`: added "Hotels grew into self-contained resort campuses" paragraph to the "pattern of growth across categories" section (between convention centers and the closing summary). Names Gaylord Opryland / Atlantis / Dorado Beach / Broadmoor with the inline anchor on the new post.
- Inbound from `friction-is-eating-demand.html`: added a mega-resort paragraph extending the "guest who turned back" sequence (between the cruise-destinations example and the "demand was there" close). Inline anchor on the new post.
- Outbound from new post (in body): `/blog/convention-center-transit`, `/blog/friction-is-eating-demand`. Related-reading grid: hospital-campus-transit, convention-center-transit, properties-got-bigger, friction-is-eating-demand.
- Net link-graph delta: 2 new inbound + 4 new outbound. Cluster: properties-got-bigger ↔ friction-is-eating-demand ↔ mega-resort-transit ↔ hospital-campus-transit (all four now reciprocally connected via at least one path).

**Push pattern from worktree (documented for repeatability):**
- Work was on `claude/keen-greider-534014` worktree branch, not master. Instead of switching branches in the main repo, pushed directly with `git push origin HEAD:master` and `git push production HEAD:master`. Both remotes were aligned at `e43dcf3` (Session 19 reconciliation holding), HEAD was a single-commit fast-forward to `6116ee7`, push to both remotes was clean.
- **Worktree push command pattern going forward:** `git fetch origin master && git fetch production master` → verify remotes match + HEAD is FF → `git push origin HEAD:master && git push production HEAD:master`. Avoids the "switch to master in main repo, merge, push" dance.

**Lighthouse audit (mobile, against live production URL post-push):**
- `/blog/mega-resort-transit` — Perf **79**, A11y **100**, BP **100**, SEO **100** | FCP 1.7s ✓ | LCP 2.7s ~ | TBT **660ms ✗** | CLS **0.001 ✓** | SI 1.8s ✓
- **Verdict: ship as-is, no fixes recommended.** A11y/BP/SEO at 100 is the structural-ship signal. Perf 79 is within site baseline (Session 17 audits 76–99 across blog posts).
- **TBT 660ms is a Lighthouse measurement artifact, not a UX issue.** GA Tag Manager accounted for 758ms of attributed blocking. Per Session 10's deferred-loading pattern (gtag.js fires on first interaction OR 2.5s timeout), Lighthouse's ~5s measurement window catches the 2.5s fallback firing — but real users don't experience this because GA loads AFTER the page is already interactive. Removing the 2.5s fallback would help the score but lose analytics on ~2% of visitors who never interact. Not worth it.
- **"Properly size images" (105KB savings on hero WebP) is Lighthouse's long-known DPR-blindness.** Test device is Moto G4 (DPR 2.6); a 412 CSS-px hero needs ~1071 physical px → correctly picks the 1200w WebP. Lighthouse compares CSS-px to image-px and flags it as oversized, but downgrading to the 640w variant would degrade quality on real high-DPR phones. Leave it.
- **LCP TTFB 651ms (24% of LCP)** is GitHub Pages cold CDN response — outside our control.
- **Cold-cache anomaly preempted** with a curl warmup before the Lighthouse run (Session 16 finding — first run of a session can show wildly inflated TBT/SI numbers).

**Followups (next session):**
- GSC manual indexing request for `/blog/mega-resort-transit` (use one of the daily ~10-URL quota slots).
- GA4 Realtime spot-check — visit the page, confirm pageview fires + scroll/first_visit events register within 30s. Cheap insurance that the deferred GA loader didn't break on this post specifically.
- 2–4 week GSC monitoring for cluster-vocabulary surfacing: `Gaylord Opryland transit`, `mega resort shuttle`, `Atlantis Paradise Island shuttle`, `hotel campus tram`, `convention hotel transportation`, `resort accessibility shuttle`. Same monitoring pattern as Session 14 (stadium-mobility-infrastructure breakthrough) and Session 17 (FSU gameday vocab). New buyer persona: hospitality directors / VP guest experience / resort GMs at branded portfolios.

### Session 21 (2026-05-11) — Theme park backstage transit blog post + gh auth account-switching gotcha

**Content shipped — "Your Cast Members Park a Mile Away. They Walk Underground to Clock In. There's a Better Way to Move Your Backstage."** (`/blog/theme-park-backstage-transit`, ~1,950 words, **Theme Parks & Attractions — new category surface**, sitemap priority 0.7, position 1 of "More articles" grid; commit `d8d952b`):
- Disney utilidor anchor narrative: cowboy-in-Tomorrowland origin story + 9-acre, 392,000-sq-ft tunnel network specifics + cast-member "walk-time" (paid minutes for the commute from utilidor entrance to work post — financial acknowledgment that the backstage walk requires compensation).
- 200,000-worker workforce framing across 9 operational departments (attractions, entertainment, F&B, merchandise, custodial, security, guest relations, maintenance, management). Named-property scale: Animal Kingdom 580 acres, Universal Epic Universe 750, Six Flags Great Adventure 510, Cedar Point 364.
- "The backstage transit problem nobody writes about" catalog: distances (mile-plus on service roads), path constraints (narrow corridors that exclude full-size buses), unmanaged golf cart fleet (same problem as everywhere else — no routes, no schedules, no consolidated movement), and shift-change peak stress (bi-directional flow on narrow service roads). Even Disney's utilidors solved visibility but not the vehicle problem — internal transport is still battery golf carts.
- Labor market angle via BuzzFeed News labor economist quote framing transportation as workforce amenity alongside housing and onsite childcare. Reinforces the Session 18 workforce-amenity thesis at the theme-park vertical.
- "The guest never sees it. The guest always feels it." closing argument: backstage transit doesn't create magic but it creates the operational reliability that makes guest-facing magic possible. Pairs structurally with the friction-is-eating-demand thesis (different surface, same mechanism).
- 5 FAQs (utilidor uniqueness, guest-tram vs backstage-tram distinction, why guests feel the result, why golf carts aren't enough, surge-capacity mechanics). 3 sourced citations (Disney Tips, Wikipedia utilidor system, IBISWorld/Wikipedia theme park careers, BuzzFeed News).

**Hero image workflow — portrait-to-landscape crop pattern:**
- Source: `theme_park_back_stage.jpg` (3600×5400 Disneyland Paris Sleeping Beauty Castle photograph, portrait orientation). Site convention is landscape heroes (1200×744). Cropped to a 3600×2232 landscape band (top y=200 to y=2432) centering the castle with dramatic sunset cloud-streaked sky; foreground brick and rail rails were below the crop line. PIL workflow: crop → resize to 1200×744 + 640×397 → save as JPG (quality 82) + WebP (quality 80, method 6). 4 final variants totaling 161KB. **Pattern documented for next time a portrait-orientation source is supplied:** decide focal point (castle, person, hero element), set crop top to position focal point in upper-third of frame, take ~half-image height as landscape band.

**Cluster integration (Session 19 publish-workflow rule — inbound links in same commit):**
- Inbound from `labor-problem-golf-cart-drivers.html`: added a "This isn't only a festival problem" paragraph extending the labor-market section. Inline anchor "theme parks" → new post. Frames the same unmanaged-cart-fleet dynamic across festival weekends (acute) and year-round theme park operations (chronic).
- Inbound from `workforce-amenity.html`: added "Theme parks competing for hourly cast members" as a fifth vertical in the existing "this isn't just a construction problem" list (hospitals → stadiums → warehouses → conventions → **theme parks**). Inline anchor on the new post + explicit reference to Disney's paid "walk-time" as the on-record financial acknowledgment that backstage commute distance has labor-cost consequences.
- Outbound from new post: `/blog/labor-problem-golf-cart-drivers` + `/blog/workforce-amenity` (in body); related-reading grid: workforce-amenity, labor-problem-golf-cart-drivers, friction-is-eating-demand, `/solutions/attractions-theme-parks` (the conversion surface for this vertical's buyers).
- Net link-graph delta: 2 new inbound, 4 new outbound. Theme parks now reciprocally linked to the workforce-amenity / labor-problem-golf-cart-drivers cluster.

**Source-MD fix during publish:**
- Source markdown linked to `/blog/workforce-amenity-ride` (does not exist — actual slug is `/blog/workforce-amenity`). Caught during HTML build, corrected before push. Worth noting that source MDs occasionally contain stale/wrong internal anchors; verify outbound links against actual `blog/*.html` filenames before publishing.

**gh auth account-switching gotcha (documented in Git workflow section above):**
- First push attempt returned `403 Permission denied to jmbradley` on BOTH origin AND production. Diagnosis via `gh auth status` revealed two GitHub accounts logged in the keychain — `jmbradley` (personal, active) and `FlexTram` (org, required for these repos). The active account's token is what `git push` uses. Switched active account via `gh auth switch --user FlexTram`; pushes then succeeded on retry without any other changes.
- Recovery cost was ~30 seconds once diagnosed. Documented in CLAUDE.md "Git workflow" section so the next time it happens (likely when someone runs personal `gh` commands and forgets to switch back), the fix is in plain sight.

**Followups (next session):**
- GSC manual indexing request for `/blog/theme-park-backstage-transit` (use a slot from the daily ~10-URL quota).
- GA4 Realtime spot-check — visit in private window, confirm pageview + scroll/first_visit fire within 30s.
- 2–4 week GSC monitoring for theme-park cluster vocabulary: `Disney utilidor`, `theme park backstage transit`, `cast member shuttle`, `theme park employee transportation`, `amusement park staff shuttle`, `Disney walk time`, `Universal Epic Universe shuttle`. New buyer persona surface: theme park ops directors / VP operations at Disney, Universal, Six Flags, Cedar Fair, SeaWorld, Merlin Entertainments.

### Session 22 (2026-05-12) — "Hits flatlined" diagnostic + SEO meta refresh on 5 impression-rich/click-poor pages

**Triage of perceived traffic cliff:**
- Joseph flagged "hits dropped off a cliff, basically flatlined since May 1." Initial concern was that something we'd shipped in recent sessions broke tracking or got the site deindexed.
- Did a full site-infrastructure sweep before speculating: all 70 production pages return 200, sitemap validates clean (67 URLs), robots.txt correctly allows everything (including AI crawlers per Session 18 work). 70 of 70 pages carry intact GA4 deferred-loading pattern (`setTimeout(loadGA, 2500)` + 6 interaction listeners). `gtag.js` reachable from Google's CDN. No commit in the last 30 days touched GA tracking in a way that could have broken it. Cleared our code as a cause before doing anything else.
- **Decisive runtime test** — used `preview_start` + `preview_eval` to load the live homepage in a real browser session and watched the GA4 network calls actually fire:
  - `GET .../gtag/js?id=G-ZYK6B5M9QT → 200`
  - `POST .../g/collect?...&en=page_view&cid=1599238841...` (the actual hit being sent to Google with a real client_id)
  - `_ga` + `_ga_ZYK6B5M9QT` cookies set
  - 4 events queued in dataLayer, zero console errors
  - **Pattern to keep:** when diagnosing "is tracking broken?" claims in the future, runtime test via preview_eval is much more decisive than reading the snippet. Snippet-present-and-valid ≠ snippet-firing. The runtime test confirms the snippet actually does the network call.
- Asked Joseph for the GA4 + GSC data. Three screenshots came back: GA4 home overview (498 YTD users, sharp peak May 1 → drop-off afterward), GA4 Traffic Acquisition channel breakdown, GSC Performance 28-day, GA4 Pages report.

**Diagnosis (the cliff is a Direct-channel publishing artifact, not a real acquisition loss):**
- Traffic Acquisition channel mix (28 days, 585 sessions):
  - **Direct: 419 sessions (71.62%)** — 18.85% engagement rate, 12s avg session
  - Organic Search: 97 (16.58%) — **59.79% engagement, 50s** ← quality
  - Referral: 37 (6.32%) — **72.97% engagement, 35s** ← AMS-driven
  - Organic Social: 33 (5.64%) — **84.85% engagement, 45s** ← excellent
- Direct's low-engagement/short-session profile is the giveaway: that's not organic acquisition. It's the mix of (a) Joseph's own publish-verification visits during the April 28–May 5 burst of 5 blog posts, (b) LinkedIn mobile clicks (LinkedIn strips referrer on mobile, lands as Direct), (c) AI-search referrer pass-through gaps (ChatGPT/Gemini citations don't reliably pass referrer), (d) cold-email-recipient clicks (most email apps strip referrer), (e) bot traffic GA4 didn't catch.
- GSC for the same 28-day window: **3.85K impressions, 37 clicks, 9.2 avg position — impressions trending flat-to-rising across April 13 → May 10 with no May 1 cliff.** Zero organic ranking degradation. The "cliff" is in the Direct channel only, and Direct doesn't reflect ranking.
- **Verdict: site is healthy. Tracking is firing. GSC is growing. The May 1 peak was a sharing/publishing artifact (Joseph's own visits + LinkedIn shares + cold-email clicks during the 5-post publishing sprint Apr 28 – May 5), which decayed back to normal-baseline as expected.** Real organic acquisition is steady.

**Insight from GSC top-queries: the real opportunity isn't traffic loss, it's impression-rich/click-poor pages:**
- `flextrolley` — **92 impressions / 0 clicks** (ranked page 4–8)
- `stadium mobility infrastructure` — 32 / 0 (page 2–3, the Session 14 breakthrough cluster still surfacing)
- `flex trolley` — 26 / 0 (same brand-variant cluster as flextrolley)
- `parking lot transport infrastructure and mobility` — 10 / 0 (Session 11 LAZ post)
- `turnkey transportation system` — 7 / 0 (Session 11 turnkey post)
- Branded comparison: `flextram` 11 clicks / 29 imps = 38% CTR; `flex tram` 2 / 15 = 13%. Same on-page quality, dramatically different CTR — position dominates CTR, not on-page work.
- **Right diagnosis:** these pages aren't failing on content. They're ranked too low to be clicked. Position fixes = backlinks (AMS upgrade ask still the highest-leverage move per Session 16). On-page CTR fix = title + meta description rewrites to match the query verbatim.

**Strategic recommendation Joseph asked for: refresh existing posts or keep publishing?**
- Hybrid: 70% new content (each new post adds query surface area, signals freshness, gives links to point at older pages — what's actually growing impression count), 20% strategic refresh on impression-rich pages (title + meta only, NOT body copy), 10% backlink outreach (AMS Tier 1 ask).
- Honest pushback: don't refresh every old post. Most have <10 impressions and aren't worth touching. Don't rewrite body copy on old posts — marginal SEO value. Don't update "modified" dates for show — Google has gotten smart about cosmetic date refreshes. Backlinks are the real lever for the flextrolley-style problem; one AMS dedicated /flextram page does more than 30 blog refreshes.

**SEO meta refresh shipped (commit `7aec80b`):**

| Page | New title | Target query (28d imps) |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | FlexTram (a.k.a. FlexTrolley) — Onsite Event Transportation | flextrolley (92) |
| `/solutions/` | FlexTram & FlexTrolley Solutions for 20 Industries | flextrolley + flex trolley |
| `blog/stadium-districts-mixed-use-transportation` | Stadium Mobility Infrastructure: The Hollywood Park Pattern | stadium mobility infrastructure (32) |
| `blog/parking-lot-mobility-origin` | Parking Lot Transport Infrastructure: The Seventh Transformation | parking lot transport infrastructure (10) |
| `blog/turnkey-mass-transit` | Turnkey Transportation System: Deploy in Two Weeks | turnkey transportation system (7) |

- Strategy applied uniformly: front-load target keyword in title, preserve editorial hook where possible, sync all 4 SERP-visible signals (title + meta description + twitter:title/description + og:title/description) per page so SERPs render consistently.
- Solutions hub specifically: previous title was `Solutions — FlexTram Systems 2026` (the trailing "2026" was odd, generic, and not keyword-relevant). Replaced with industry-count specificity and the brand-variant.
- Homepage specifically: previous title omitted "FlexTrolley" entirely despite the variant being in body copy and `alternateName` JSON-LD. 92 impressions/zero clicks on `flextrolley` was the title-tag signal mismatch. Now title-tag agrees with body and schema.
- Sitemap: lastmod bumped to 2026-05-12 for all 5 affected URLs to prompt Google recrawl with new metadata. XML validates clean.

**Expected outcome (calibrated):**
- Will NOT move ranking position — that's a backlink/authority problem
- Should move CTR at the same position — title matches the query verbatim, more clickable SERP snippet
- 2–3 weeks for Google to recrawl + re-index the new titles before impact shows in GSC
- Measurement: in 3 weeks, check GSC for the 5 target queries. Clicks-per-impression should climb from 0% to 2–5%. If it stays at 0%, the issue isn't title — it's depth-of-ranking (page 4+).

**Methodological wins from the session:**
1. **Runtime tracking diagnostic via preview_eval beats static snippet inspection.** Whenever someone asks "is GA broken?" — load the live URL in preview, watch the actual `g/collect` POST fire. Cookies + dataLayer + network call all in one ~3 second test.
2. **Cross-check GA4 against GSC before blaming our code.** If Users dropped but GSC Impressions are steady-or-growing → it's not a ranking issue. If GA4 dropped but GSC also dropped → could be algorithmic. If only GA4 dropped → tracking issue OR a single high-volume channel (Direct/LinkedIn) lost momentum.
3. **Low-engagement Direct sessions are the publisher's own visits.** Filter internal traffic in GA4 (Admin → Data streams → Configure tag settings → Define internal traffic). Reduces both noise and false "peaks" during publish sprints. Already in the TODO list from prior sessions; promoted to higher visibility.
4. **Don't refresh content body copy as a default SEO play.** Title + meta rewrite is the highest-leverage CTR move at a fraction of the time cost. Body copy rewrites are for pages that aren't surfacing at all (zero impressions), not pages ranked too low to click.

**Followups (next session):**
- Submit the 5 refreshed URLs (`/`, `/solutions/`, the 3 blog posts) via GSC URL Inspection → Request Indexing to accelerate recrawl. Uses 5 of the ~10/day quota; worth it because the goal is title-tag refresh propagation.
- In 3 weeks (~2026-06-02), re-pull GSC top queries. Watch the 5 target queries for CTR movement. Success = 1–4 clicks where there were 0. Failure mode = still 0 clicks → diagnosis shifts from "title mismatch" to "position too deep" (needs backlinks not metadata).
- Filter internal traffic in GA4 Admin so future publish-burst spikes don't inflate Direct.

### Session 23 (2026-05-14) — GSC "why pages aren't indexed" triage + senior-living-independence blog post

**GSC indexing triage:**
- Joseph surfaced the GSC "Why pages aren't indexed" dashboard, flagged the "Page with redirect" row (1 page) for investigation. Diagnosed inline without code changes — confirmed it's `landing-page.html` (the Session 19 commit `6784f9d` redirect from Paper Kit template artifact → `/`). Live page check confirmed: `noindex,follow` + canonical to `/` + meta refresh + JS fallback. **Working as designed.** Google correctly not indexing because we asked it not to; "Not Started" validation is informational, not an error.
- Triaged the other 3 rows together:
  - **"Alternate page with proper canonical tag"** (19 pages, validation "Failed") — same `.html` vs pretty-URL pattern Session 12 documented. GitHub Pages serves both URL forms; canonical tag tells Google to prefer pretty URL; Google "fails" the validation but correctly de-duplicates. Working as designed. Ignore.
  - **"Page with redirect"** (1 page) — landing-page.html, see above. Ignore.
  - **"Discovered — currently not indexed"** (7 pages, validation "Started") — **down from 22 in Session 12.** Healthy trajectory. Google knows about them via sitemap, just hasn't crawled. Fix: manual indexing requests for high-priority URLs from the daily ~10/day quota. **This is the only row with actual leverage.**
  - **"Crawled — currently not indexed"** (0 pages) — clean.
- **Pattern to keep:** ~3 of the 4 GSC indexing-flag categories are working-as-designed signals that show up as "errors" in the UI. When triaging, classify each row before reaching for a fix. Only "Discovered — not indexed" and (if it ever appears) "Crawled — not indexed" need action.

**Content shipped — "Your Residents Chose This Community for Independence. The 300 Yards Between Their Apartment and the Dining Hall Is Taking It Away."** (`/blog/senior-living-independence`, ~2,150 words, **Senior Living**, sitemap priority 0.7, position 1 of "More articles" grid; commit `71796d1`):
- Anchor narrative: Howard County 2026–2030 Age-Friendly Action Plan listening sessions placed transportation as the **second-most-urgent priority — behind only housing, ahead of healthcare**. Howard County is home to Charlestown by Erickson Senior Living (110 acres, 2,000+ residents, 1,100 staff, climate-controlled walkways) — yet transportation still ranked second. The walkways connect the buildings; the distance between buildings is the barrier.
- Industry-scale framing: Erickson Senior Living's pipeline (Grandview Bethesda 33 acres / 1,300+ units, Emerson Lakes 87 acres / 1,000+ units, proposed Franklin TN 75 acres / 1,250 units). Brookdale 675+ communities across 40+ states. Acts Retirement-Life Fairhaven 300 acres.
- "Walking distance is a health outcome" reframing: National Academies isolation-as-premature-mortality stat ("comparable to high blood pressure, smoking, or obesity"). 25–50% of adults over 65 experience loneliness; >70% in some congregate-living settings. U.S. News / USAging: **#1 cause of loneliness in older adults is physical disability or lack of mobility** — not loss of spouse or separation from family.
- "Built on greenfields. Without transit." structural argument: senior communities built on cheap large-parcel outskirts land produce campuses whose distances were designed for active 65-year-olds and become barriers as those residents age into their 80s and 90s. Campus doesn't change. Resident does. Walkway infrastructure doesn't adapt to mobility decline.
- Reactive-solutions catalog: golf-cart-on-request, scooter rentals, climate-controlled walkways, external shuttles. Each confirms the problem; none is a system.
- Staff problem mirrors resident problem (1,100 staff / 2,000 residents / 110 acres at Charlestown). Pairs with workforce-amenity thesis at the senior-living vertical — CNAs, dietary, maintenance recruitment/retention dynamic.
- "Portfolio opportunity" pitch directly to Erickson, Brookdale, Acts: standardized transit platform across 20–600+ campuses as a brand-level differentiator. Same logic as Session 20's mega-resort-transit Ryman pitch.
- 5 FAQs with FAQPage JSON-LD; full BlogPosting + BreadcrumbList + Organization JSON-LD; OG/Twitter; canonical; 8 sourced citations (Howard County, Erickson SHN forecast, Budget Seniors / Capital Funding Group, Apartments.com Brookdale ranking, Acts Retirement, National Academies of Sciences, U.S. News / USAging, InTouchLink, Indiana Public Media WFIU greenfield framing).

**Hero image — portrait-to-landscape crop methodology (Session 21 pattern, second application):**
- Source: `seniorcommunnity.jpg` (4160×6240, portrait architectural campus model photograph — planned community model with central plaza + curving paths + house pieces + model trees). Cropped middle band y=400 to y=2979 (height 2579, 1200:744 ratio), centered the focal-point circular plaza. Resized to 1200×744 (JPG 115KB + WebP 57KB) + 640×397 mobile (JPG 36KB + WebP 18KB). 4 variants, 226KB total. **Portrait-source crop pattern is now repeatable** — used at theme-park-backstage (Session 21) and senior-living-independence (Session 23) successfully.

**Cluster integration (Session 19 publish-workflow rule — inbound links in same commit):**
- Inbound from `friction-is-eating-demand.html`: added inline anchor on the existing "Building C / 300 yards / book club / her knees" senior-living passage — the new post echoes that exact scene as its closing argument, so the link is contextually seamless. Reader in friction post is already in senior-living context when they hit the anchor.
- Inbound from `mega-resort-transit.html`: added "senior living communities" inline anchor to the parallel-verticals list ("the same one that stadiums, convention centers, hospitals, senior living communities, and cruise destinations face").
- Outbound from new post (in body): workforce-amenity, friction-is-eating-demand. Related-reading grid: friction-is-eating-demand, workforce-amenity, hospital-campus-transit, `/solutions/senior-living` (conversion surface).
- Net link-graph delta: 2 new inbound, 4 new outbound. Senior living now reciprocally linked into the friction-eating-demand / campus-too-big-to-walk cluster alongside hospital-campus-transit, mega-resort-transit, properties-got-bigger.

**Source-MD recurring bug (worth flagging as a pattern):**
- Same broken outbound link as theme-park-backstage source MD (Session 21): `/blog/workforce-amenity-ride` (which does not exist) instead of `/blog/workforce-amenity`. Caught during HTML build, corrected before push. This is the second time the same wrong slug has appeared in source MDs. **Whatever upstream generator is producing these source MDs has a stale link template.** Worth mentioning to Joseph next time he's prepping a source MD — fixing it upstream prevents the recurring publish-time correction.

**Followups (next session):**
- GSC manual indexing request for `/blog/senior-living-independence` (use a slot from the ~10/day quota).
- GA4 Realtime spot-check — visit in private window, confirm pageview + scroll/first_visit fire within 30s.
- 2–4 week GSC monitoring for senior-living cluster vocabulary: `Erickson Senior Living transportation`, `senior living campus shuttle`, `CCRC campus mobility`, `retirement community tram`, `Charlestown Erickson transit`, `senior campus people mover`, `Brookdale community shuttle`. New buyer persona surface: VP operations / chief operating officers at Erickson, Brookdale, Acts, Senior Lifestyle, Holiday by Atria, Sunrise Senior Living.
- **Cold-outreach play to senior living portfolios** — Session 23 senior-living-independence post explicitly names Erickson, Brookdale, and Acts and frames standardized portfolio transit as a brand-level differentiator (same playbook as mega-resort-transit / Ryman pitch from Session 20). Approach: "you might find this interesting" intro email with the post link — let the post do the positioning work. Pair with `/solutions/senior-living` as the conversion surface.

### Session 24 (2026-05-15) — Lighthouse audit + homepage CLS deep-dive (failed one-line fix, reverted; deeper diagnosis filed)

**Lighthouse 3-page baseline established (mobile, against live production):**

| Page | Perf | A11y | BP | SEO | LCP | TBT | CLS | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/` (homepage) | 63 (cold) / **87 (median)** | 97 | 100 | 100 | 5.4s cold / 2.54s median | 90-260ms | **0.143** | CLS regression |
| `/blog/senior-living-independence` | **96** | 100 | 100 | 100 | 2.7s | 0ms | 0.002 | Excellent |
| `/solutions/senior-living` | **92** | 100 | 100 | 100 | 2.7s | 60ms | 0.018 | Solid |

- **Cold-cache anomaly confirmed (Session 16 finding) again.** Homepage first-run measured Perf 63 / LCP 5.4s; median of 3 runs settled at Perf 87 / LCP 2.54s. Always run a curl warmup pass first and use 3-run median for any meaningful Perf/LCP signal. Single-run noise is dramatic.
- **Blog template + solution template are excellent.** Post-Session-17 WebP work + deferred-loading pattern is paying compounding dividends. Ship pattern is healthy — new posts and solution pages don't need any performance work.
- **Homepage CLS 0.143 is real (not noise).** 3-pass median came back 0.142 / 0.143 / 0.144 — deterministic within 0.0019 across runs. Above Google's 0.10 'Good' threshold, in 'Needs Improvement' band.

**CLS smoking gun identified via Lighthouse `layout-shifts` audit JSON:**
- **99% of the CLS (0.142 of 0.143)** traced to a single element: `div.features-2 > div.container > div.row > div.col-md-4` containing the "Independently Turning Axles" features card. The other 3 layout-shift items combined to 0.0019 — negligible.
- **Root cause:** the May 1 commit `db8842d` ("Fix nav logo rendering small after CLS fix") set the nav logo's `width="900" height="184"` attrs to native dimensions on the theory that *"modern browsers derive aspect-ratio from width/height attrs without forcing the rendered width to match the attribute."* That theory holds **only when CSS has already loaded**. The site defers Paper Kit + Bootstrap CSS, so for the brief window before they load, the browser falls back to intrinsic dimensions and renders the logo at 900×184 — inflating the navbar to ~184px tall. Once CSS arrives, `.navbar-brand img { max-width: 25% }` collapses the logo to ~225px wide, navbar shrinks to ~50px, and **everything below shifts up by ~134px**, including the features-2 cards.

**Failed one-line fix attempt (commit `dbba2b3`):**
- Tried: added `style="width:225px;height:auto;"` to the nav logo, theory being inline style would force the rendered width before deferred CSS loads while width/height attrs preserved the 4.89:1 aspect ratio for space reservation.
- Result was **catastrophic:** post-fix 3-pass Lighthouse measured CLS at 0.902 / 0.148 / 0.928 (median 0.902 — **6.3× worse than pre-fix**). 2 of 3 runs landed in **'Poor' CLS territory (>0.25 = Google ranking penalty)**.
- **Reason the fix backfired:** by forcing the navbar to its small final size from first paint, the page-header / video-background layout timing changed in a way that exposed an intermittent CLS at the hero `<video>` element (`label="FlexTram micro-mobility vehicle in action at a live event"`). The video element's load lifecycle now raced with `.page-header { min-height: 100vh }` layout — sometimes video loaded after layout settled (CLS 0.14), sometimes during (CLS 0.90).
- **Reverted in commit `bbbd0cb`.** Back to the stable 0.143.

**Critical learning to remember:**
- **The homepage has at least TWO stacked CLS sources.** The navbar shift was MASKING a worse intermittent video-container shift. Fixing one alone exposes the other. They need to be fixed together, not sequentially.
- **Don't try one-line CLS fixes on the homepage.** Every quick fix touches layout timing, and the legacy stack (Slick + Bootstrap + Paper Kit + jQuery + hero video) has multiple interacting layout triggers. A single change shifts the timing race in unpredictable directions.
- **The proper fix is the long-deferred homepage overhaul.** Multi-day project: inline `.page-header` + `.video-background` critical CSS, restructure how video container reserves space, possibly remove parallax (`data-parallax="true"`), possibly replace Slick with vanilla JS carousel. Until that happens, homepage CLS will float in the 0.10–0.18 range — annoying, above the 'Good' threshold, but not catastrophic. Site still ranks position 1.06 for branded `flextram` search; no organic-traffic blocker.

**Methodological wins:**
1. **3-pass median is essential for CLS** at this site. Single-run can be 0.14 OR 0.90 for the SAME page state depending on race conditions. Never act on single-run CLS data.
2. **Lighthouse `layout-shifts` audit JSON** (under `audits.layout-shifts.details.items`) gives exact selector + score per shifting element. Pull this BEFORE proposing any fix. Saves chasing the wrong element.
3. **Always run a verify-after-ship audit** before declaring success on a perf fix. Tonight's catastrophe would have shipped invisibly without it.
4. **gh CLI active account reverts to `jmbradley` between sessions.** Confirm with `gh auth status` and switch back to FlexTram before pushing. Hit this again tonight — now the third occurrence (Session 21 + Session 22 + Session 24).

**Followups (next session / queued):**
- Homepage performance overhaul remains the only real fix for the CLS issue. Multi-day project, not a sprint task. Don't attempt incremental fixes until ready to do the full job — the legacy-stack interactions make every one-line attempt brittle.
- Re-pull the 3-page Lighthouse baseline in ~2 weeks to confirm blog template + solution template stayed at 96 / 92 Perf.
- The existing "Diagnose homepage CLS 0.223 regression" TODO is now resolved as fully diagnosed but unfixed; updated TODO entry reflects this.

### Session 25 (2026-05-16) — ADA demand-surge post, link audits, AI-search pattern documented, Operator's Atlas concept parked

**Content shipped:**
- Published "28 Million People Will Need Accessible Transportation by 2030. Your Golf Cart Program Isn't Ready." (`/blog/ada-demand-surge`, ~2,000 words, **Accessibility & ADA — new category**). Anchored on the November 2025 Santa Barbara Access Advisory Committee finding (State Street Loop golf cart shuttle ruled non-ADA-compliant despite vendor modifications). Cites 4 real venue ADA programs with their actual operational language: Highmark Stadium (Bills) / Clemson / Texas Longhorns / PGA Championship. Demographic-surge framing: 65+ population +42% by 2050, older adults with activity limitations doubling to 28M by 2030. Sitemap priority 0.7, position 1 in the More Articles grid. Per Session 19 publish-workflow rule, shipped with 2 inbound cluster links (fleet-liability-insurance and senior-living-independence in the same commit).

**Link-graph audits:**
- **Internal link audit:** 74 production HTML files, 2,037 internal refs (`href` / `src` / `srcset` / `imagesrcset` / `action`), **zero broken.** First-pass false positives were all `?v=` cache-busting query strings — files exist.
- **External link audit:** 126 distinct external URLs, 2 genuine rotted citations fixed (brightsparks.co/event-staffing-trends and nationalbus.com ADA-rules — both replaced with working sources). Confirmed false positives left in place (Buffalo Bills `/stadium/accessibility-guide`, Budget Seniors Erickson page, etc. — bot-blocker 404s in curl/python that Google still indexes with our exact cited content; pages exist for real browsers).

**llms.txt drift cleanup:**
- 4 missing recent posts added: `ada-demand-surge`, `senior-living-independence`, `theme-park-backstage-transit`, `mega-resort-transit`.
- Removed duplicate `/solutions/convention-centers` entry (was listed twice).
- New cluster header **"Campus mobility: senior living, hospitality, attractions"** — 3 property-type posts justified a section per the ~3-post threshold rule. `ada-demand-surge` filed under the flagship "Industry analysis" cluster instead of standalone "Accessibility & ADA" (single-post categories don't justify a section header).

**Process artifacts promoted into CLAUDE.md (forward-looking, surfaces every session):**
- **Publish-workflow rules** moved from buried session retrospectives into the active "Blog system" section: the Session 19 inbound-link rule + new Session 25 llms.txt-update rule + sitemap entry / hero-image variants / hub-card requirements. Three categorization principles included: one post = one home, ~3 posts per section header, section order = importance.
- **AI-search Boolean-query pattern section** documenting the operator-heavy queries surfacing in GSC across 6+ verticals — cruise (with mid-query iteration × 3), Ingredion, Capital Funding Group, Louisville-data-center, Nowsta, HIMSS. These are NOT human typed queries — they're Perplexity / Gemini Deep Research / ChatGPT search / Claude with web search issuing programmatic Boolean queries on behalf of B2B researchers. Syntax fingerprints documented (long `-site:` exclusion lists = Perplexity/Gemini; pipe-OR = classic operator syntax; lowercase `or` = ChatGPT/Claude). Maintenance rule: **don't prune named entities from existing content** — citation density is a feature on this surface, not a stylistic cost. 5 high-priority monitoring TODOs added.
- **Operator's Atlas concept parked** with 2026-05-23 revisit. Concept: new IA section `/atlas/` housing structured per-vertical directories of named entities (cruise destinations, data center campuses, NFL stadiums, etc.) — paired with the AI-search pattern as the proposed response (entity density is exactly what AI-search tools surface). Format spec, naming rationale ("atlas" carries practitioner-compiled-reference connotation; "list" reads as SEO marketing, "guide" implies how-to), IA placement reasoning, sequencing (cruise destinations first based on the GSC iteration signal), maintenance constraint (3 atlases fine; 12 abandoned atlases = "site is dead" signal). Open questions for revisit: IA URL pattern, schema markup, nav placement, editorial commentary standard.

**Closed TODOs:** outbound citation hardening; AI-search awareness as documented site practice; Atlas concept captured for revisit.

### Session 26 (2026-05-17 to 2026-05-22) — 2 new posts, vocab tune on 2 existing, savings calculator (build + Phase 1 linking + Formspree saga), Lighthouse + 2 a11y fixes

Long multi-day session. Five concrete threads.

**1. Content shipped (2 new posts + industry-vocab tune on 2 existing):**
- Published "You Spent $2 Billion on the Stadium. The Parking Lot Is Still 1987." (`/blog/parking-lot-still-1987`, Stadiums & Fan Experience). Names dollar figures across 7 named stadium projects: Levi's $200M, Penn State $700M, Williams-Brice $350M, new Bills $1.4B, Titans $2.1B, Bears Arlington Heights $5B, Royals $2B. Inbound cluster links from `hidden-cost-of-making-fans-walk` and `stadium-districts-mixed-use-transportation` (the high-impressions B2B research surface from Session 14).
- Published "What Happens in the Week Operators Don't Talk About" (`/blog/build-to-operate-seam`, **Golf Tournament Operations — new category**, ~900 words). **Inside-the-trade operator voice register preserved** — no mid-article CTA block, no sticky floating CTA, no "— The FlexTram Team" signoff, no "as we wrote in" body insertions, 3 JSON-LD blocks instead of 4 (no FAQPage — source had no FAQ content, voice register favored lean). Tracy West (Valspar / 3M Open) + Jackie Endsley (2026 PGA at Aronimink) quotes kept verbatim. Inbound cluster links from `golf-tournament-spectator-experience` + `already-paying-for-transportation`. **First piece on the site in the operator voice register** — watch engagement; if it pulls strong, the inside-the-trade voice could become a register option for future B2B-vertical pieces.
- **Industry-vocabulary tune pass on 2 high-priority existing posts:**
  - `factory-workers-walking-two-hours`: "worker" → "associate" across title / meta / OG/Twitter / H1 / subtitle / first 4 body paragraphs / FAQ Q+A / BlogPosting JSON-LD / FAQPage JSON-LD (29 "associate" mentions vs 4 retained "worker" refs). Added pickers / packers / stowers / sorters role-specific terms. New paragraph landing UPH (units per hour) / throughput / non-task time / Connecticut HB 5333 productivity-quota framing. Named Walmart / Target / Costco / UPS Supply Chain alongside the existing Amazon ref.
  - `data-center-crew-retention`: new body paragraph naming 5 data-center specialty trades (low-voltage electrician / power specialist / cooling specialist / generator technician / fire protection technician), each appearing 2× (body + new FAQ Q). Added "mission-critical construction" framing × 2 + IECI / NECA / ABC / AGC apprenticeship-pathway retention frame (8 trade-body mentions). FAQ count 5 → 6.
  - **3 more data-center posts already TODO'd** for the next vocab-tune pass: `4000-workers-one-campus`, `data-center-construction-people-moving`, `workforce-amenity` — same patterns (worker → trades/crew/subs, + site mobilization + front-end planning + mission-critical construction + specialty-trades list).

**2. Savings calculator shipped — `/savings-calculator` (NEW conversion-funnel page):**
- Joseph supplied a standalone HTML calculator (golf cart fleet → FlexTram cost-savings tool, with blurred-total email gate). **Original gate was non-functional** — "Send my report" just removed CSS blur client-side, no Formspree backend, falsely claimed "Check your inbox for your savings summary." Would have burned every lead the gate captured. Rebuilt as a real integrated site page:
  - Wired the email gate to Formspree — async POST with email + source tag + calc fields (`fleet`, `flextrams_needed`, `annual_savings_range`, `five_year_range`) + honeypot.
  - GA4 deferred snippet + `savings_calculator_submit` event (params: `flextrams_needed`, `annual_savings_low`, `annual_savings_high`). Homepage `cta_click` selector extended to catch calculator clicks with `cta_type: 'savings_calculator'`.
  - Full SEO meta (title, description, OG/Twitter, canonical, keywords, BreadcrumbList + Organization JSON-LD). Favicon, theme-color.
  - Font swap from source's Inter Tight + Fraunces → site's DM Sans + Instrument Serif (non-blocking preload pattern). Orange swap `#E55A2B` → site's canonical `#c44323`. Instrument Serif weight declarations dropped to 400 (single-weight face — avoids faux-bold synthesis on heading elements).
  - Logo wrapped in `<a href="/">`. Otherwise lean — no full site nav, matching `/request-a-bid` + `/procurement-packet` conversion-funnel-page pattern.
  - **Gate copy reframed** to remove the false "Report sent. Check your inbox" promise. New copy: "Drop your email and Joseph will follow up with a personalized breakdown..." + post-unlock confirm "You're all set. Your numbers are unlocked above. Joseph will follow up — typically within one business day." Honest about the personal-follow-up model (no automated PDF pipeline).
- Sitemap entry priority 0.8 (conversion tool tier, matches procurement-packet). llms.txt entry under "Get in touch" cluster.

**3. Savings calculator — the Formspree saga (worth documenting because it took multiple round-trips to resolve and surfaced a bigger site-wide finding):**
- First test: submission returned `ok:true` from Formspree but no email arrived to Joseph. Diagnostic fetch from preview confirmed Formspree was accepting (`{"ok":true,"next":"/thanks?language=en"}`). So code + mechanism worked; problem was Formspree-side delivery.
- **Root cause via Joseph's Formspree dashboard:** the original shared `mvzzoarr` form ("Inquiry From Website") is **drowning in spam — ~188 submissions / 30 days, spam line dominates, inbox line near zero.** Formspree's per-form spam filter was classifying calculator submissions as spam and silently dropping email notifications (submission still recorded in Spam tab of dashboard, but no email goes out).
- **Fix step 1:** Joseph created a dedicated Formspree form `mykvjpbo` ("Savings Calculator"). Rewired the calculator's fetch endpoint.
- **Fix step 2:** first test on the dedicated form ALSO landed in Spam — fresh forms with no submission history default to trigger-happy spam classification. Switched submission from JSON POST to **multipart FormData** (looks like a standard browser form post to Formspree's filter, not API/bot traffic).
- **Fix step 3:** Joseph dropped Formspree's spam filter entirely on the `mykvjpbo` form. Defensible: dedicated form (only the calculator posts there), low expected volume, JS honeypot (`_gotcha` check) still guards bot submissions before they ever reach Formspree.
- **End-to-end verified working** — Joseph's May 22 test arrived with every calc field intact (`fleet "12 six-seaters + 8 four-seaters"`, `flextrams_needed 4`, `annual_savings_range $292K – $323K`, `five_year_range $1.46M – $1.61M`, real email, correct `_subject`).
- **`mvzzoarr` finding is the bigger open issue** — the homepage contact form, `/request-a-bid`, and `/procurement-packet` ALL post to `mvzzoarr`. If calculator submissions were getting spam-buried, those forms' legitimate leads probably are too. Queued as new high-priority TODO; pattern for the fix (dedicated forms + spam-filter relax + honeypot) is now proven.

**4. Savings calculator — Phase 1 linking into the site (calculator shipped as orphan with NO on-site links until this pass):**
- **Homepage module:** new "Run the numbers →" orange-pill CTA after the "Golf carts are for golf. Vans are for the highway." body copy paragraph (the natural thematic lead-in). Subtle subtitle: "Already running a golf cart fleet? See what consolidating into FlexTram saves on labor, fuel, insurance, and maintenance — with live, traceable math." Subordinate to the existing "Let's talk!" contact CTA above it.
- **4 economics blog post inline links:** `labor-problem-golf-cart-drivers` (after the $4,320-vs-$72,000 driver labor math), `fleet-liability-insurance` (in the "fewer vehicles, fewer operators" consolidation paragraph), `shuttle-bus-vs-flextram` (after the "is it cheaper" cost question), `already-paying-for-transportation` (after the $200K-$700K direct-cost total).
- **4 fleet-heavy solution-page CTAs:** golf-courses, stadiums-arenas, university-campus, resort-hotel. Inline link appended to each existing `.cta-block` paragraph ("Already running a golf cart fleet? See what consolidating into FlexTram saves..."). Subordinate to each page's primary "Get in Touch" CTA — no competing button.
- **Nav placement DEFERRED — Phase 2 decision at ~2026-06-29** (4–6 weeks post-launch). Reasoning: calculator is golf-cart-fleet-specific, not universal (a festival promoter / cruise terminal / data-center GC doesn't have a "cart fleet" to plug in). A global nav slot creates an audience mismatch. Contextual links self-target to fleet operators. Matches `/request-a-bid` + `/procurement-packet` IA precedent (conversion-funnel tier, also not in nav). Promote on data, not instinct.

**5. Lighthouse audit pass — 4 pages, 2 a11y fixes shipped + 1 known-parked issue confirmed:**

| Page | Perf | A11y | BP | SEO |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/savings-calculator` | 94 | 95 → **100** ✓ | 100 | 100 |
| `/blog/build-to-operate-seam` | 99 | 100 | 100 | 100 |
| `/blog/parking-lot-still-1987` | 99 | 100 | 100 | 100 |
| `/` (homepage, 3-run median) | 82 | 97 → **100** ✓ | 100 | 100 |

- **Calculator A11y fix:** Lighthouse flagged `color-contrast` failure — `--mid` color `#888780` on cream `#f1efe8` background was only 3.13:1 (below WCAG AA 4.5:1 for normal text). Affected `.label-aside` and `.hint` helper text. **Exact precedent from Session 5** — the main site darkened this same tertiary color for the same reason. One-line fix: `--mid: #888780` → `#6b6a64`. New contrast 4.77:1, clears AA. A11y 95 → 100.
- **Homepage A11y fix:** Lighthouse flagged `aria-input-field-name` failure — Slick carousel 1.6.0 applies `role="listbox"` to the JS-generated `.slick-track` with no accessible name. Added 4-line post-init JS to set `aria-label="FlexTram client logos"` on the track. Verified the attribute lands on the right element + carousel still initializes normally. Re-audited post-deploy: A11y 100, zero failing audits.
- **Homepage CLS 0.148 — STILL PARKED.** 3-run median deterministic (0.147/0.148/0.149). Lighthouse `layout-shifts` audit pointed to the EXACT same element Session 24 identified: `div.features-2 > div.container > div.row > div.col-md-4` (the "Independently Turning Axles" features card), scoring 0.142 of the 0.148. Session 24 diagnosis verbatim confirmed unchanged. Next-experiment plan already documented in CLAUDE.md TODOs (remove `data-parallax`, etc.). NOT touching here — Session 24's one-line fix attempt made CLS 6× worse and had to be reverted. Needs the real homepage pass with runway, not another brittle one-liner. "Needs Improvement" band, not a ranking penalty (penalty starts at 0.25), and `/` still ranks #1 for "flextram" — real but not urgent.
- **Homepage Perf 82 median** — runs 70/84/82 (the 70 is the Session 16 cold-cache anomaly, discarded). Holding in the low-80s — up from the 45–48 video-hero era of Session 17, comparable to Session 24's median 87. Within variance, healthy.

**Closed TODOs from prior sessions:**
- "Send one real test submission through /savings-calculator" — DONE, verified end-to-end (Joseph's May 22 test, every calc field intact).
- "Confirm the savings-calculator blur gate ON/OFF decision" — DONE, Joseph kept it ON (real lead capture).

**New open items going into next session:**
- **`mvzzoarr` spam-flooding investigation** (new high-priority TODO). The big finding from this session — same form-level spam classification issue likely affects the homepage contact form, bid form, and procurement-packet form. Need to verify whether real leads through those are reaching Joseph's inbox or being silently spam-buried. Fix pattern proven (dedicated forms + filter relax + honeypot).
- **`savings_calculator_submit` as a Key Event in GA4 Admin** — last remaining calculator-build TODO. Without the star, the conversion won't count in reporting.
- **3-post data-center vocab tune pass** still queued (4000-workers / data-center-construction-people-moving / workforce-amenity).
- **Operator's Atlas revisit** still queued (was 2026-05-23 — today; may already be addressable depending on session timing).
- **Homepage CLS** still parked with documented next-experiment plan.

## TODOs for next session

### High priority — AI-search surface monitoring (new 2026-05-16)
- [ ] **2026-05-23 REVISIT: Operator's Atlas format decision.** Concept parked 2026-05-16, full design notes in the "Operator's Atlas" subsection of the Blog system area of CLAUDE.md. Need to resolve: (a) IA placement (`/atlas/` vs nested), (b) schema markup choice (Dataset / ItemList / BlogPosting), (c) nav-placement decision (link in main nav or search-discovery only), (d) editorial-commentary-per-entry standard. If approved, first atlas = cruise destinations (10–20 entries: CocoCay, Labadee, Royal Beach Club Nassau, Celebration Key, Half Moon Cay, Castaway Cay, Lighthouse Point, Great Stirrup Cay, Harvest Caye, Ocean Cay, etc.). Watch first atlas 4–6 weeks before committing to atlas #2.
- [ ] **Track which posts the AI-search Boolean queries are sending traffic to.** GSC 2026-05-16 pull surfaced operator-heavy queries hitting cruise / Ingredion / Capital Funding Group / Nowsta / HIMSS / Louisville-data-center research. Map each query to the landing URL in GSC (Performance → Pages filter by query) so we know which posts are AI-tool magnets and which aren't. Use that mapping to decide where to invest content depth.
- [ ] **Watch CTR specifically on the operator-heavy queries.** If impressions are high and clicks are zero, the AI tool is citing without sending a click (AI Overviews / Perplexity citation surface — traffic may show as `(direct)` in GA4). If clicks are non-zero, AI-tool-driven sessions are landing. Different attribution paths → different optimization moves.
- [ ] **Publish the cruise destination-by-destination expansion** (Half Moon Cay, Castaway Cay, Lighthouse Point, Royal Beach Club Nassau, Great Stirrup Cay). The 2026-05-16 GSC pull showed an AI researcher iterating on the same cruise-industry query 3 times in a row with progressively tighter exclusions — that researcher needs vertical depth and is digging. This is the cleanest signal yet for the Session 18 destination-expansion TODO. Pair with cold outreach to RCL / Carnival / MSC / Disney / NCL destination teams.
- [ ] **Build "named entity hub" pages** (one per top-AI-search vertical). E.g., a cruise destinations reference page that names 15+ owned cruise destinations with parent companies, acreage, and tram-relevant details. Same for major data center campuses, NFL stadiums, mega-resort portfolios, Power 4 athletics venues. Designed to be exactly what an AI-tool Boolean query is looking for: dense, named-entity-rich, authoritative, no fluff. Treat these as a new content category, not blog posts.
- [ ] **Avoid pruning named entities from existing content.** When editing for readability, do NOT remove company names, dollar figures, regulation citations, named people, named venues, or named properties — those are why the AI-search surface works. The rule is the inverse of classical SEO copy editing.
- [ ] **Industry-vocabulary tune pass: 3 remaining data-center construction posts.** Session 26 (2026-05-18) shipped vocabulary alignment on `factory-workers-walking-two-hours` (worker → associate + UPH/throughput/time-on-task/HB 5333) and `data-center-crew-retention` (added 5 specialty trades + IECI/NECA/ABC/AGC apprenticeship framing). Same vocabulary gaps documented in the audit are present in 3 more posts: `4000-workers-one-campus`, `data-center-construction-people-moving`, `workforce-amenity`. The fixes: (a) shift dominant noun from "workers" → "trades"/"crew"/"subs" where natural, (b) insert "site mobilization" + "front-end planning" as discipline framing (these are data-center-GC budget line items the posts currently miss), (c) name "mission-critical construction" — the industry's own self-description — in body of each, (d) add the same specialty-trades list (low-voltage electrician / power specialist / cooling specialist / generator technician / fire protection technician) where the post talks about who's on site. `workforce-amenity` is closest to right already (lightest touch); `4000-workers` and `data-center-construction-people-moving` need fuller passes. Pattern is replicable — same scope as the 2-post pass that took ~30 min on 2026-05-18.

### High priority — Formspree `mvzzoarr` spam-flooding investigation (new 2026-05-22)
- [ ] **Verify real leads through the homepage contact form / `/request-a-bid` / `/procurement-packet` are actually reaching Joseph's inbox.** Session 26 discovered the shared `mvzzoarr` Formspree form ("Inquiry From Website") is drowning in spam: ~188 submissions / 30 days per the Formspree dashboard, the spam line dominates, inbox line near zero. The calculator's first test submission was the smoking gun — it landed in the Spam tab despite being a perfectly legitimate submission. The contact form, bid form, and procurement-packet form ALL post to `mvzzoarr` too — so any legitimate lead through them could be getting silently spam-filtered the same way (Formspree returns `ok:true` to the client, records the submission in the dashboard's Spam tab, sends NO email notification). Action: (a) check Joseph's actual inbox against known recent real leads — the PVGP / Hinterland / Coachella inbounds — were those received as Formspree emails or through other channels (LinkedIn / direct email / phone)? (b) Log into Formspree, open the `mvzzoarr` form, scroll the Spam tab and look for any legitimate-looking submissions buried there. If yes → mark them Not Spam (trains the filter), and replicate the calculator's fix for the bid + procurement forms (dedicated Formspree forms with spam filters relaxed). Pattern documented in Session 26.

### High priority — savings calculator follow-through (shipped 2026-05-18, verified end-to-end 2026-05-22)
- [x] ~~**Send one real test submission through `/savings-calculator`.**~~ **DONE 2026-05-22** — Joseph's production test landed with every calc field intact (`fleet`, `flextrams_needed`, `annual_savings_range`, `five_year_range`, `email`, `_subject`). Full Formspree saga in the Session 26 status entry: ended up needing (a) dedicated Formspree form `mykvjpbo` because original shared `mvzzoarr` is spam-flooded, (b) switch from JSON to FormData POST (looks like standard form post, not API call — less spam-prone), (c) drop Formspree's spam filter on the dedicated form (safe — low volume + JS honeypot `_gotcha` check still guards).
- [ ] **Mark `savings_calculator_submit` as a Key Event in GA4 Admin** — Admin → Events → star it. Same pattern as `bid_request_received` (Session 12). Until starred it won't count as a conversion in reporting. The event fires on successful gate submit with params `flextrams_needed`, `annual_savings_low`, `annual_savings_high`. **This is the last remaining calculator-build TODO.**
- [ ] **Phase 2 nav decision — revisit ~2026-06-29 (4–6 weeks post-launch).** The calculator shipped linked from homepage + 4 blog posts + 4 solution pages, deliberately NOT in the main nav (golf-cart-fleet-specific, not universal — self-targets better via contextual links). Decide on nav placement based on GA4 data: (a) engagement time on `/savings-calculator` — interactive tools should run high vs. the site's ~12s Direct-channel baseline; (b) `savings_calculator_submit` volume; (c) `cta_click` with `cta_type=savings_calculator` sliced by `cta_location` to see which surface (homepage/blog/solutions) drives clicks. Strong engagement + submits → earned the nav slot. Quiet → contextual links are the right home, nav would just dilute "Get in Touch."
- [x] ~~**Confirm the savings-calculator blur gate ON/OFF decision.**~~ **DONE 2026-05-22** — Joseph kept the gate ON (real lead capture). Headline total + 5-year number stay blurred until email is submitted; line-by-line math card stays visible the whole time.

### High priority — active leads + time-sensitive
- **Daytona International Speedway / Frank Kelleher** — conversation has advanced past initial cold-outreach phase as of Session 23 (2026-05-14). Operational follow-up triggers (silent Lyndsey ping, etc.) no longer applicable. Strategic context preserved for future reference: NASCAR Southeastern Region = Daytona + Talladega + Richmond + Martinsville + Homestead halo; "Chip's 13-track portfolio" (NASCAR-owned tracks) is the obvious next-conversation seed once DIS deploys; Frank's Rock music festival mention is the unlock for the year-round utilization / non-racing events angle. References primed if needed: PVGP, Hinterland, SoCal 300-carts-to-8.
- [ ] **Monitor airport-FBO engagement 48–72 hrs after the vocabulary rewrite (shipped 2026-04-19)** — Session 10's tone rewrite (accusatory → investigative) got engagement from undetermined to 3s, but didn't move further. Today's fix injected FBO-native vocabulary (crew car, quick turn, Part 135, transient, based, FOD) across hero/pain cards/pills/FAQ/CTA. Hypothesis: buyers now pattern-match "this is for me" in the first 3 seconds. Goal: 3s → 10s+ (matches stadiums-arenas baseline). If it moves, audit healthcare-hospitals and senior-living for similar vocabulary-match gaps (medical/clinical and senior-living ops teams both have distinct terminology).
- [ ] **Request FSU "use Kari as reference" permission separately** — Session 17 secured full-attribution usage rights for the quote (deployed across homepage + 3 solution pages). The reference role for Power 4 booster outreach is a distinct ask Joseph hasn't made yet. Once granted, unlocks credible cold outreach to: Texas Longhorn Foundation, Tennessee Fund, Iron Bowl/Tide Pride, Georgia Bulldog Club, Gator Boosters, Texas A&M 12th Man Foundation, Buckeye Club, Wolfpack Club. Booster orgs talk to each other.
- [ ] **Collect 2 more real testimonials** — FSU is the first; the deployment pattern (`.testimonial-block` component) is now proven and ready to receive 2 more. Once 3 are on hand, consider rotating the homepage placement, adding vertical-specific quotes on matching solution pages, and a `/case-studies` or `/clients` page. Likely candidates to ask: an Ingredion site contact (factory-tours / grand-openings vertical), a festival ops contact (Bonnaroo / Coachella / EDC), a NASCAR-region operations contact.

### Medium priority — content expansion
- [ ] **GA4 Realtime spot-check for `/blog/senior-living-independence`** — visit in private window, confirm pageview + scroll/first_visit fire within 30s.
- [ ] **Watch GSC for senior-living cluster vocabulary** (2–4 week horizon, starting from indexing requests submitted 2026-05-14) — `Erickson Senior Living transportation`, `senior living campus shuttle`, `CCRC campus mobility`, `retirement community tram`, `Charlestown Erickson transit`, `Brookdale community shuttle`. New buyer persona surface: VP operations / COOs at Erickson, Brookdale, Acts, Senior Lifestyle, Holiday by Atria, Sunrise Senior Living.
- [ ] **Cold-outreach play to senior living portfolios** — Session 23 post explicitly names Erickson, Brookdale, Acts and frames standardized portfolio transit as a brand-level differentiator (same playbook as Session 20 Ryman/Marriott pitch for mega-resort post). Approach: "you might find this interesting" intro email with the post link. Pair with `/solutions/senior-living` as the conversion surface.
- [ ] **In ~3 weeks (≈2026-06-02), re-pull GSC top queries for the 5 refreshed targets** — `flextrolley`, `flex trolley`, `stadium mobility infrastructure`, `parking lot transport infrastructure`, `turnkey transportation system`. Success: CTR moves from 0% to 2–5%. Failure: stays 0% → diagnosis shifts to "ranked too deep" (backlinks problem, not title problem).
- [ ] **Filter internal traffic in GA4** — Admin → Data streams → Web stream → Configure tag settings → "Define internal traffic" → add Joseph's IP. Then Admin → Data filters → set "Internal traffic" filter to **Active** (not Testing). Stops Joseph's publish-verification visits + day-to-day site browsing from inflating Direct sessions and creating false "publishing spike" peaks. Was already a Session 11/15 TODO; promoted in priority because today's diagnosis showed this is the primary cause of the May 1 visual cliff.
- [ ] **GA4 Realtime spot-check for `/blog/theme-park-backstage-transit`** — visit in private window, confirm pageview + scroll/first_visit fire within 30s.
- [ ] **Watch GSC for theme-park cluster vocabulary** (2–4 week horizon) — `Disney utilidor`, `theme park backstage transit`, `cast member shuttle`, `theme park employee transportation`, `amusement park staff shuttle`, `Disney walk time`, `Universal Epic Universe shuttle`. New buyer persona: theme park ops directors / VP operations at Disney, Universal, Six Flags, Cedar Fair, SeaWorld, Merlin Entertainments.
- [ ] **Watch GSC for mega-resort cluster vocabulary** (2–4 week horizon) — `Gaylord Opryland transit`, `mega resort shuttle`, `Atlantis Paradise Island shuttle`, `hotel campus tram`, `convention hotel transportation`, `resort accessibility shuttle`. New buyer persona: hospitality directors / VP guest experience / resort GMs at branded portfolios (Ryman/Marriott/Hilton). Same breakthrough-pattern monitoring as stadium-districts (Session 14) and FSU gameday vocab (Session 17).
- [ ] **Cold-outreach play to multi-property hospitality brands** — Session 20 mega-resort-transit post names Ryman Hospitality Properties (Gaylord Hotels) explicitly and frames standardized portfolio transit as a brand-level differentiator. Targets: Ryman corporate strategy / Gaylord Hotels brand team; Marriott Convention Hotels group; Hilton's large-footprint brands (Waldorf Astoria, Conrad). Approach: "you might find this interesting" intro email with the post link — the post does the positioning work. Pair with `/solutions/resort-hotel` for the conversion surface.
- [ ] **Write "What Data-Driven Means for Your Gameday Shuttle" post** — FSU's testimonial used "data-driven solutions adaptable to our evolving needs" unprompted. Differentiator vs. any golf cart rental co. Turn the jargon into concrete value (utilization rates, route optimization, peak-hour modeling, historical patterns). Good mid-funnel content for athletics ops buyers.
- [ ] **Watch GSC for FSU-vocab keyword surfacing** — shipped Session 17: `gameday parking operations`, `data-driven shuttle operations`, `P4 athletics shuttle`, `collegiate athletics shuttle`, `matchday parking operations`, `race day parking operations` across 5 stadium-cluster pages (stadiums-arenas, football-stadiums, fifa-world-cup, raceways-motorsports, university-campus). Body copy already carries these via the FSU testimonial. 2–4 week horizon. Same monitoring pattern as Session 14 stadium-mobility-infrastructure cluster. Lever for athletics ops buyers.
- [ ] **Consider an `/operations` or `/planning` page** -- Surface the ops planning layer (heat maps, route modeling, schedule integration) that FSU specifically called out as valuable. This is the "platform" story your original homepage hinted at, told through operational credibility instead of vague platform-speak.
- [ ] **Vertical-specific OG images** -- All 7 "placeholder" pages now share the branded `og-flextram-v1.jpg` (Built to Move) as a baseline. Long-term improvement: design page-specific 1200×630 OG images for solutions hub, blog hub, convention, golf, labor, and planned communities (each showing a scene matching the vertical). Nice-to-have, no longer urgent — the branded shared image is strictly better than the prior pic3.JPG placeholder.
- [ ] **Write more blog articles** -- Continue weekly publishing cadence beyond April 29. Content is primary traffic driver (organic sessions +188% across session 8).
- [ ] **Monitor GSC for key query movement** -- Watching: "flex tram" (holding position 4.5?), "flextrolley" (moved from position 80?), "flex shuttle" (new appearance April 17 — rising?), "shuttle bus alternative" / "tram rental" (new keywords added yesterday - impressions?), new queries from shuttle-bus / venue-isnt-stadium / curb-to-gate posts.
- [ ] **Watch for more AI referrals** -- gemini.google.com + duckduckgo/organic already appearing. Expect more AI tool citations as content cluster grows.
- [ ] **Consider LAZ / Propark / Metropolis outreach** — curb-to-gate post positions FlexTram as the onsite mobility layer parking operators need to complete the fan journey product. Opens partnership conversation. LAZ Live! at 100 venues (Truist Park / Battery Atlanta reference) is the prime target.
- [ ] **Cold-outreach play to cruise line destination/strategy teams** — Session 18 cruise-destination-transit post is the door-opener content asset. Targets: Royal Caribbean Group destination operations (CocoCay, Labadee, Royal Beach Club Nassau), Carnival Cruise Line guest experience team (Celebration Key, Half Moon Cay), MSC Ocean Cay operations, Disney Cruise Line (Castaway Cay + Lighthouse Point under construction on Eleuthera), Norwegian Cruise Line (Great Stirrup Cay). Approach: "you might find this interesting" intro email with the post link, NOT an RFP pitch — the post does the positioning work. Pair with the existing `/blog/cruise-terminals-people-moving` for end-to-end story (homeport + destination).
- [ ] **Watch GSC for cruise-destination vocabulary surfacing** — 2–4 week horizon. Target queries: `CocoCay tram`, `Celebration Key tram`, `cruise destination transportation`, `cruise island tram`, `private island shuttle`, `owned cruise destination transit`. Same pattern as the Session 14 stadium-mobility-infrastructure breakthrough (3→152 imps on B2B research vocab). If named-destination queries surface, consider parallel posts on Half Moon Cay / Castaway Cay / Lighthouse Point / Royal Beach Club Nassau as the destination-by-destination expansion play.
- [ ] **Monitor bid form funnel** — /request-a-bid shipped today. Watch for first submissions, and which of the 3 conversion paths converts best (homepage contact form vs. bid form vs. Calendly). GA4 `cta_click` event has `cta_type` + `cta_location` parameters for slicing. **(As of Session 12: custom dimensions registered, conversion events starred. Build the slicing Explore on or after 2026-04-22 — needs 3+ days of forward data because historical 14 cta_click events are stuck as "(not set)".)**
- [ ] **Homepage performance overhaul (major)** — Homepage Lighthouse mobile stuck at 40–55 because of jQuery + Bootstrap + Paper Kit + Slick carousel. The ranking-critical solution pages are 88–90 because they don't carry this legacy JS. A real rebuild of homepage JS stack (drop jQuery dependency, replace Slick with vanilla JS carousel) could push it into the 70–80 range. Bigger project — don't tackle unless a week of runway.
- [ ] **Consider "Back-of-House Staff Transportation" solution page or post** — Hinterland's 16–32 tram bid request was explicitly about staff movement, not fans. Back-of-house is a distinct vertical underserved by current front-of-house-heavy content. Festival-season-here blog post hits this briefly; could be its own solution page.
- [ ] **Mark `procurement_packet_received` as Key Event in GA4 Admin** — Session 19 shipped the gated procurement-packet funnel with `procurement_packet_submit` (form) + `procurement_packet_received` (thank-you arrival) custom events. Once the first submission fires (probably within 1–2 weeks given the recent inbound flow), star the `_received` event as a Key Event in GA4 Admin → Events. Same pattern as `bid_request_received` from Session 12. Without the star, it doesn't count as a conversion in reporting.
- [ ] **Watch GA4 source-segmentation impact of CTA nomenclature change** — Session 19 retired Session 10's "Request Quote" homepage submit in favor of "Send Message," predicting that quote-intent traffic would route to the better-instrumented `/request-a-bid` funnel. 2–3 week horizon to confirm. Signal of success: bid-form submission volume goes up, homepage form's quote-stage inbound goes down (visible in form `message` field language). Signal of regression: total conversion volume drops without a compensating bid-form increase. If regression, revert homepage submit to "Request Quote."
- [ ] **Watch GSC for procurement-packet vocabulary** — Session 19 shipped `/procurement-packet` with keyword-rich meta. Target queries: `FlexTram procurement packet`, `tram rental RFP`, `event transportation procurement`, `vehicle specifications FlexTram`, `FlexTram ADA compliance`, `FlexTram insurance COI`. Same monitoring pattern as cruise-destination vocab. If procurement-vocabulary impressions surface, consider building `/for-procurement-teams` companion content (still gated; just more SEO real estate for procurement-stage buyers).

### Performance opportunities (surfaced by Session 16/17 Lighthouse audit, real measurements)
- [ ] **Homepage CLS — fully diagnosed Session 24, next-experiment plan ready.** Current state: median CLS 0.143 (above Google's 0.10 'Good' threshold, in 'Needs Improvement' band). Diagnosed via 3-pass Lighthouse + `layout-shifts` audit JSON: 99% of CLS comes from features-2 cards being pushed down when the navbar collapses on deferred CSS load. Root cause: nav logo `width="900" height="184"` attrs (set May 1 by `db8842d`) cause browser to render logo at intrinsic 900×184 before CSS loads, then collapse to ~225px once CSS arrives → navbar height drops → cards shift up. **One-line fix attempted (`dbba2b3`) and reverted (`bbbd0cb`)** — adding `style="width:225px"` to the logo exposed a second intermittent CLS at the hero `<video>` element, making CLS 6× worse (median 0.902, 2/3 runs in 'Poor' territory). The two CLS sources are stacked; fixing one alone exposes the other.

  **Verified state of inlined critical CSS at line 63 of index.html** — the page-header + video-background styles ARE already inlined:
  - `.page-header { min-height: 100vh; display: flex; align-items: center; position: relative; overflow: hidden }`
  - `.video-background { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100% }`
  - `.video-background video { position: absolute; top: 50%; left: 50%; transform: translate(-50%, -50%); object-fit: cover }`

  So the video tag IS supposed to be absolutely positioned from first paint and shouldn't be able to cause sibling shift. Yet Lighthouse measured it shifting 0.50 + 0.40 magnitude post-fix. The mechanism is not 100% understood. Two most likely culprits:
  1. **`data-parallax="true"` on `.page-header`** — Paper Kit's parallax JavaScript re-positions elements during scroll. If parallax JS runs after first paint and re-computes video position, it would cause a shift. **Most likely culprit** based on symptoms (intermittent, race-condition driven, only affects above-the-fold).
  2. **`preload="metadata"` on the `<video>` element** — video fetches metadata (duration, intrinsic dimensions) when page loads. When metadata arrives, browser may re-render video. If `object-fit: cover` interacts with metadata's intrinsic dimensions, that could cause a shift.

  **Next-experiment plan (in order, one-at-a-time, re-audit between each):**
  1. **Remove `data-parallax="true"` from `.page-header`** — one attribute deletion, 30-second experiment. Re-audit with 3-pass median. If parallax was the culprit, CLS should drop significantly. **30% probability this alone is enough.**
  2. **If #1 doesn't work, remove `preload="metadata"` from the video** — one attribute deletion. Re-audit. **20% probability this alone is enough.**
  3. **If neither works alone, try both together.** **30% probability combined is enough.**
  4. **If still no improvement, replace hero video with static image.** Lose some brand polish but eliminate CLS root cause. Decide whether to bring video back as below-the-fold lazy-loaded element. **20% probability the underlying issue is something else entirely** (Slick interactions, Bootstrap reflow, Paper Kit JS re-layout) requiring deeper investigation.

  **Discipline for the next attempt:**
  - **Pull Lighthouse `layout-shifts` JSON BEFORE shipping any fix** to confirm which element(s) are actually shifting in the current state. Don't propose a fix based on a hypothesis without evidence.
  - **Use 3-pass median** for verdict, not single runs. Single-run CLS at this site can vary 0.14 → 0.90 for the same page state.
  - **Re-audit immediately after each ship.** Tonight's catastrophe would have shipped invisibly without it.

  Site still ranks position 1.06 for branded `flextram` — no organic-traffic blocker, so the urgency is real but not critical. CLS in the 0.10–0.18 range is "Needs Improvement" but not a Google ranking penalty (that starts at 0.25).
- [ ] **Run 3-page perf-baseline audit on next session start** — Session 17 single-run Lighthouse showed `stadiums-arenas` slipped 90 → 88 (within typical variance per Session 16). 3-run median would tell us whether the dip is real or noise. Do same for `airport-fbo` (89→99 was big) and `stadium-districts-blog` (76→96). Confirms whether the WebP wins hold at high traffic.
- [ ] **Homepage video bottleneck (still open)** — `/` Lighthouse mobile holding ~45–48 because of the 2.3MB hero video + Slick carousel + Bootstrap+jQuery+Paper Kit legacy stack. WebP heroes don't help here (homepage doesn't use the hero-* image system). Real fix is the larger homepage rebuild (drop jQuery, replace Slick with vanilla JS carousel, further compress or replace the hero video). Multi-day project — don't tackle without runway.

### Closed via Session 16 real Lighthouse audit (no code change needed)
- ✅ **Nav logo unsized-images** — speculative TODO from session memory. Real Lighthouse audit on both new pages scores Accessibility 100; `unsized-images` audit does NOT flag. The inline `style="height: 30px"` is sufficient for Lighthouse on these pages. No 45-file edit needed.
- ✅ **Orange CTA color-contrast** — speculative TODO. Real audit scores Accessibility 100 / Best Practices 100; `color-contrast` audit does NOT flag. White on `#c44323` at font-weight 700 / 14px = 5.0:1 contrast which passes WCAG AA. CSS already correct. No code change needed.

### Low priority
- [ ] **Reach out to Power 4 booster orgs for outbound** -- With Kari's reference (once secured), FlexTram has a credible door-opener to: Texas Longhorn Foundation, Tennessee Fund, Iron Bowl/Tide Pride, Georgia Bulldog Club, Gator Boosters, Texas A&M 12th Man Foundation, Buckeye Club, Wolfpack Club. These orgs talk to each other.
- [ ] **LinkedIn post referencing FSU partnership** -- With Kari's permission, a short LinkedIn post tagging Seminole Boosters would reach exactly the collegiate athletics audience we want.
- [ ] **Consider adding a /specs page** -- Multiple solution pages reference specs.
- [ ] **Reach out to AMS Event Rentals** -- Only existing referral backlink. Ask about a dedicated FlexTram page with more content/linking. Relevant backlinks are #1 lever for non-branded rankings.
- [ ] **LinkedIn share of the manifesto post** -- "Why Isn't Transportation on the List?" designed to be shareable, best top-of-funnel content.
- [ ] **Coachella Weekend 2 content push** -- Consider homepage banner, festivals page callout, recap post.

### New from Session 11 — monitor (most items now resolved in Session 15)
- [ ] **Monitor parking-lot-mobility-origin discovery** — post shipped buried (sitemap 0.5, mid-grid above curb-to-gate). Expect slow organic surfacing vs featured posts. Watch GSC for LAZ-related query impressions ("LAZ Parking mobility", "Charge Where You Park", "LAZ Live") over 7–14 day window.
- [ ] **If `git push production master` ever rejects again** — the guard failed silently or a scheduled auto-publish landed ahead of a manual push (as happened 2026-04-22). Recovery pattern: `git fetch production && git pull --rebase production master`, resolve any sitemap.xml / blog/index.html conflicts, `git push production master && git push origin master --force-with-lease`. Alternative non-destructive fast-forward if fork lags: `git fetch production && git push origin production/master:master`.

### New from Session 15 — action + monitor
- [ ] **Rerun CTA Type Explore on or after 2026-04-29** — today's 3-event baseline is real but small. 7+ days of forward data will tell us whether the pattern (100% alt-CTA, 0% contact_form on cta_click) holds or reverts. Same Explore setup as today; date range April 19 → whenever.
- [ ] **April 29 scheduled auto-publish is the test case for the workflow image-sitemap patch.** Draft: "Sponsorship's Untapped Frontier" in `blog/_drafts/2026-04-29_sponsorship-untapped-frontier.html`. When it publishes, verify the sitemap entry includes an `<image:image>` block. If yes → workflow patch validated, no further action. If no → fall back to manual sitemap patch in same shape as 2026-04-22 fan-experience-gap fix (30 sec).
- [ ] **Watch engagement time on the 4 "campus-resident asset" solution pages** — healthcare-hospitals (rewritten 4/21), senior-living + planned-communities + resort-hotel (rewritten 4/22). 2–4 week horizon. If the "vehicle lives on your property, operated as needed" positioning resonates, engagement time rises. If flat, the rewrite is invisible to traffic (= content velocity / top-of-funnel growth is the real lever, not copy).
- [ ] **Watch for new GSC queries from `/blog/fleet-liability-insurance`** — target B2B research vocabulary: "golf cart liability venue," "event premises liability," "dangerous instrumentality," "pedicab insurance requirements," "venue fleet risk management." Same breakthrough-pattern as stadium-districts (3→152 imps on research vocab); different audience persona (risk managers, event insurance brokers, underwriters).
- [ ] **Monitor LinkedIn UTM attribution** — Joseph started tagging LinkedIn shares with `?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=POST_SLUG` from today forward. Expect hidden LinkedIn mobile-app traffic (currently landing as `(direct)`) to start surfacing as proper linkedin/social sessions within 2–3 weeks of consistent tagging. Check GA4 Traffic Acquisition 28-day over the coming weeks — LinkedIn's current 7-session attribution should rise to ~15–25.

### New from Session 12 — mostly resolved; remaining monitoring items
- [ ] **Explore historical GSC "Discovered — not indexed" crawl inventory** — 22 pages is a lot. If the issue persists after manual indexing, consider tightening sitemap priorities on lower-value pages (drops /landing-page, consolidates older blog posts) to focus crawl budget.
- [ ] **Ignore cruise-terminals indexing flags permanently** — both "Crawled — currently not indexed" (Failed) and "Alternate page with proper canonical tag" flags for `/blog/cruise-terminals-people-moving.html` are working as designed (GitHub Pages serves both URLs, canonical correctly points to pretty URL, Google shelves the .html). The canonical pretty URL IS indexed. Don't click Validate again — it will keep "failing" because Google is correctly refusing to index the duplicate.
- [ ] **DebugView sanity check (optional)** — Admin → DebugView. Append `?debug_mode=1` to any flextram.com URL, click a CTA, confirm `cta_type` / `cta_location` params show up in real-time. Useful if the Explore (after 3 days) shows unexpected gaps.

### Done in Session 19 (removed from list)
- ✅ **Site hygiene scan** — 55 HTML files audited, 0 broken internal links, 0 missing alt tags, all "25 passenger" references confirmed legitimate (golf-cart comparison math), all year references intentional.
- ✅ **Built `/where-we-operate`** — service-area page with explicit US + Canada coverage. Initial version named clients (Coachella, FSU, Wakefern, etc.) — Joseph correctly pushed back on disclosing the named-account list publicly while the moat is being built. Removed the regional grid; coverage statement stays explicit but client list stays private.
- ✅ **Built `/procurement-packet` (gated lead-capture)** — initial proposal was an open spec page; Joseph correctly flagged moat concern. Pivoted to gated form-driven funnel that signals procurement-grade documentation exists without disclosing it. 5-required-field form, custom GA4 events instrumented, sitemap priority 0.8.
- ✅ **Bid-form lead-paragraph link styling fix** — `.bid-hero .lead a` had no visible link affordance. Added brand-orange + 1px underline at 3px offset; hover darkens. Bumped `bid-request.css` to `?v=2` cache-bust.
- ✅ **CTA nomenclature standardization site-wide** — 245 replacements across 55 HTML files + 5 straggler fixes. 6+ verbs collapsed to 4 (Get in Touch / Send Message / Request a Bid / Request the Packet). Architecture preserved; pure label cleanup.
- ✅ **Published `/blog/the-pattern`** — ~2,250-word industry-analysis piece synthesizing Coachella, Kentucky Derby, Super Bowl, F1, and Arlington pedicab ban. Position 1 of "More articles" grid. Sitemap priority 0.7.
- ✅ **April 29 auto-publish workflow image-sitemap patch validated** — "Sponsorship's Untapped Frontier" auto-published with proper `<image:image>` block on first scheduled run since the patch shipped 2026-04-22.
- ✅ **Internal-link audit (2 passes)** — orphans 11 → 5 → 0. Every blog post now has at least 1 inbound blog→blog link. 16 inline cross-links added across 12 host files. New publish-workflow rule established: add 1–2 inbound links from existing cluster pieces in the same commit when publishing a new post.
- ✅ Closed TODO: "Build 'Where We Operate' or service-area page"
- ✅ Closed TODO: "Build 'For Procurement Teams' resources page" — replaced architectural decision with gated lead-capture variant per moat discussion.

### Done in Session 18 (removed from list)
- ✅ Published `/blog/cruise-destination-transit` (~2,400 words, **Cruise Destinations & Port Operations — new category**, sitemap priority 0.7, position 1 of "More articles"). Targets Royal Caribbean / Carnival / MSC / Disney / NCL destination teams directly.
- ✅ Hero image: Celebrity Beyond at Caribbean port. Generated 4 variants (1200×900 JPG + WebP, 640×480 mobile JPG + WebP) using Python PIL per Session 17 site-wide pattern.
- ✅ Reciprocal cross-linking — added cruise-destination-transit card to `/blog/cruise-terminals-people-moving`'s related-reading grid; new post links back to cruise-terminals + `/solutions/cruise-terminals` + `/blog/curb-to-gate-fan-journey` + `/blog/turnkey-mass-transit`.
- ✅ Sitemap entry with `<image:image>` block (priority 0.7, lastmod 2026-04-28). XML validated clean.
- ✅ 5 sourced citations (Royal Caribbean, TravelAge West, Cruise Hive, Carnival FAQ, EatSleepCruise, Professor Melissa Cruises) with `target="_blank" rel="noopener"`.

### Done in Session 17 (removed from list)
- ✅ Refreshed sitemap lastmod across all 50 URLs to 2026-04-27 after morning's site-wide a11y commit (`d6d564a`).
- ✅ **Closed Session 5 TODO: locked in FSU testimonial usage rights** — Joseph confirmed full attribution for Kari Terezakis (EVP, Seminole Boosters · FSU). Quote deployed across 4 pages.
- ✅ Built `.testimonial-block` CSS component (italic body, orange Georgia opening quote, bold attribution, mobile-responsive). Lives in global.css for solution pages; identical CSS inlined in homepage critical CSS since homepage uses Bootstrap+custom.css stack.
- ✅ Placed FSU testimonial on homepage + football-stadiums + stadiums-arenas + university-campus solution pages, following "testimonial right before CTA as conversion closer" pattern. Verified at desktop 1280px and mobile 375px; no console errors.
- ✅ Closed Session 16 follow-up TODO: WebP hero conversion shipped site-wide. 86 new WebP files (40 × 1200px hero variants + 38 × 640px mobile + 6 event-photo variants + hero-poster.webp). Total 14.2MB → 6.2MB (56.8% reduction).
- ✅ Wrapped 44 HTML files' hero `<img>` elements in `<picture>` elements with WebP source + JPG fallback. Updated 43 `<link rel="preload" as="image">` hints to `type="image/webp"` + WebP href.
- ✅ Closed Session 16 follow-up TODO: blog post template TBT regression diagnosed AND resolved. Heavy JPG hero decoding on long article bodies WAS the long task. Lighthouse on `/blog/grand-opening-transportation`: 78 → 93–99 (TBT 860ms → 0–290ms).
- ✅ Closed Session 16 follow-up TODO: Lighthouse mobile validation across 5 sample pages confirmed WebP perf lift generalizes. Stadium-districts blog 76 → 96 (+20). Airport-fbo 88 → 99 (+11). Pattern: pages with heavy hero images dominating perf budget jumped 11–20 points; no material regressions.
- ✅ Added FSU-vocab keywords (`gameday parking operations`, `data-driven shuttle operations`, `P4 athletics shuttle`, `collegiate athletics shuttle`, `matchday parking operations`, `race day parking operations`) to 5 stadium-cluster pages. Body copy now agrees with meta declaration via the FSU testimonial deployment.

### Done in Session 15 (removed from list)
- ✅ Built GA4 CTA Type slicing Explore and CTA Location Explore — verdict on Session 11 homepage redesign: alt-CTA paths are capturing clicks (100% of 3 events over 3 days went to bid_form + calendly, all from body/homepage). Redesign validated at the margin.
- ✅ Pulled full Events report — found 3 form_submit_success / 1 bid_request_received = 4 documented conversions / 199 users / 28 days = 2% overall lead rate. Homepage form converts at 5.7% from form_visible to form_submit_success (~2× B2B benchmark).
- ✅ Closed Session 11 TODO: "Monitor homepage contact CTA redesign" — verdict is in, no further iteration needed, grow top-of-funnel instead.
- ✅ Closed Session 12 TODO: "Build the CTA Type slicing Explore" — done.
- ✅ Closed Session 12 TODO: "Manual indexing requests for priority URLs" — Joseph submitted today's queue through GSC.
- ✅ Discovered LinkedIn driving 7 attributed sessions + AMS Event Rentals driving 6 from a single existing backlink (validates AMS backlink-upgrade asks as high-leverage).
- ✅ Gave Joseph UTM-tagging protocol for future LinkedIn shares (`?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=POST_SLUG`) to capture the hidden 2–3× mobile-app traffic currently landing as `(direct)`.
- ✅ Published "You Don't Know Who's Driving on Your Property. Neither Does Your Insurance Company." (~2,000 words, Risk & Operations — **new category**, buried position 15, sitemap priority 0.5). Targets venue risk managers, event insurance brokers, underwriters.
- ✅ Recovered from auto-publish merge conflict when fan-experience-gap auto-published ahead of manual fleet-liability-insurance push — documented the recovery pattern for future self-reference.
- ✅ Retroactively added `<image:image>` sitemap entry for fan-experience-gap during the merge-conflict resolution (auto-publish hadn't emitted one because the workflow predates the image-sitemap extension).
- ✅ **Patched auto-publish workflow to emit `<image:image>` blocks** going forward — BLOG_META `image:` + `image_alt:` fields now feed the sitemap image extension. Falls back gracefully if a draft lacks image fields. Next auto-publish (April 29) is the validation test.
- ✅ Extended "vehicle stays onsite, operated as needed" positioning across 3 additional solution pages (senior-living, planned-communities, resort-hotel) matching yesterday's healthcare-hospitals pattern. Vertical-specific intensity: medium/medium/light respectively. Preserved each page's core user-benefit framing (resident consistency / residential noise / continuous guest loop) while layering in the operator-side flex story.
- ✅ Sitemap lastmod refreshed for the 4 edited solution pages to 2026-04-22 (were stale at 04-17/04-19). Joseph requested GSC indexing on all 4.

### Done in Session 14 (removed from list)
- ✅ Published "Systems Over Units: Why Smaller Vehicles Don't Solve Bigger Crowd Problems" (~2,000 words, Industry, structurally pairs with cities-solved-this as a two-post decision framework argument)
- ✅ Added reciprocal cross-links between cities-solved-this ↔ systems-over-units (inline "no system" anchor + related-reading card both directions)
- ✅ Diagnosed stadium-districts GSC breakthrough (3 → 152 weekly impressions on B2B research queries) — identified vocabulary pattern and shipped adjacent-page keyword expansion
- ✅ Added "stadium mobility infrastructure" + "stadium transportation hub connectivity" to meta keywords on 5 stadium-cluster pages (stadiums-arenas, football-stadiums solution pages; courtesy-shuttle, football-parking, hidden-cost blog posts)
- ✅ **Meta description long-tail sweep — 31 pages closed.** The Session 13 deferred TODO is done. All pages now have descriptions ≤160 chars, with og/twitter/JSON-LD description fields synced per page for consistent SERP signal.
- ✅ Caught and fixed stale capacity reference: `solutions/healthcare-hospitals.html` meta description said "up to 25 patients" (pre-Session-2 value) — corrected to 27
- ✅ Closed three inbound leads off the high-priority TODO block: PVGP (Ross Miller), Hinterland Music Festival, Coachella warm lead
- ✅ Honest caveat documented in commit + session log: Google deprecated meta keywords as ranking signal in 2009. Real lever for research-query ranking is body copy + backlinks — meta keywords are the free declaration layer only.

### Done in Session 13 (removed from list)
- ✅ Published "Cities Solved This 100 Years Ago. Why Haven't Venues?" (~2,100 words, Industry, urban-transit-applied-to-venues manifesto)
- ✅ Fixed link-equity split on solutions hub — dropped `.html` from all 19 ItemList JSON-LD URLs so ItemList agrees with canonical + sitemap
- ✅ Bulk-refreshed sitemap lastmod dates on 37 stale entries (pulled true most-recent git commit date per file)
- ✅ Noindexed `landing-page.html` (Paper Kit template artifact that was ~95% duplicate of homepage)
- ✅ Ran "anything else like this" structural audit — found and fixed 11 `target="_blank"` missing `rel="noopener"`, 3 wildly-wrong wordCount values in BlogPosting JSON-LD, tightened 4 highest-traffic page meta descriptions (homepage, solutions hub, blog hub, cities-solved-this)
- ✅ Lifted blog hub title from 23 → 65 chars ("FlexTram Blog | Onsite Transportation & Venue Operations Insights")
- ✅ Defined AMS Event Rentals backlink-upgrade asks for Joseph to send direct (dedicated /flextram page, varied anchor text with target keywords, deep-links to solution pages, internal links from their high-traffic pages)

### Done in Session 12 (removed from list)
- ✅ Registered 4 GA4 custom dimensions (CTA Type, CTA Location, Service Model, Source Tag) — all Event scope
- ✅ Marked key events: `bid_request_received`, `form_submit_success`, `bid_request_submit`, `cta_click`
- ✅ Verified Session 11's Enhanced Measurement toggle worked — `form_submit` ghost events dropped out of top 10 in GA4

- ✅ Documented CLAUDE.md with GA4 dimension setup + GSC triage for next-session continuity

### Done in Session 11 (removed from list)
- ✅ Diagnosed form submissions as bots (GA4 `form_submit` via Enhanced Measurement catching browser submits; honeypot server-side filtering; `form_submit > form_start` inversion = textbook bot signature)
- ✅ Disabled GA4 Enhanced Measurement "Form interactions" (keeping only custom conversion events)
- ✅ Investigated "flex tram" GSC position drop — sample-composition noise, not a real regression

- ✅ Site-wide OG image sweep — same branded image now on landing-page, solutions hub, blog hub, labor-companies, convention-centers, golf-courses, planned-communities (7 additional pages)
- ✅ Remote SHA reconciliation — force-pushed origin to match production; all three locations (origin, production, local) aligned on single linear history; cherry-pick pattern retired
- ✅ Airport-FBO page vocabulary rewrite — extracted FBO-industry language from AeroCenters + Universal Aviation service descriptions, applied across title/meta/OG/hero/pain cards/solution block/use-case pills/FAQ/CTA; claims "crew car" + "quick turn" + "Part 135" + "transient" + "based" + "FOD" vocabulary the buyer actually searches and uses
- ✅ Blog mid-article CTA fix — promoted `.post-cta-inline .btn-primary` into orange pill family in `global.css`; resolved teal-cascade rendering bug across all 15+ blog posts using the mid-article CTA pattern
- ✅ Full-site CTA audit — confirmed no remaining orphan Request Info buttons; bid thank-you page's 3 black-pill buttons are legitimate tier-2 design, not bugs
- ✅ Published "Your Courtesy Shuttle Is Doing More Work Than Your Org Chart Admits" (~1,900 words, Stadiums & Arenas, buried mid-grid above stadium-districts for thematic cluster, AT&T Stadium + Arlington pedicab context, 300-to-8 carts case study)

### Session 27 (2026-05-27) — Repo cleanup, gh-account-mismatch engineered away (the credential helper, not the failed pre-push hook), World Cup last-half-mile post, full site audit, 52-entry sitemap refresh

Long single-day session covering four distinct phases.

**1. Repo hygiene reckoning (session start):**
- Local was 25 commits behind both remotes and had a stash of staged changes from an abandoned worktree session sitting in the index — including deletions of 3 still-live blog posts (`mega-resort-transit`, `senior-living-independence`, `theme-park-backstage-transit`) and a sitemap rollback from May → April dates. Smoking gun confirmed it was stale, not new work.
- Cleaned via `git stash` (preserved CLAUDE.md IndexNow doc + settings.local.json edits), `git reset --hard origin/master`, then surgically extracted the IndexNow doc back into the now-current CLAUDE.md.
- Audited git fsck dangling commits — all 6 were old April stashes from prior worktree sessions, all superseded by 25 commits of newer origin work. **No real work was lost.**
- Deleted 2 stray `claude/dreamy-cray-258aac` and `claude/keen-greider-534014` branches from prior worktree sessions.
- Committed and pushed the recovered IndexNow doc (`462f0de`).

**2. gh-account-mismatch 403 — engineered away (with one failed approach first):**
- **Failed first attempt:** built `.githooks/pre-push` (tracked hook via `core.hooksPath`) that checks `gh auth status` and rejects pushes when active account isn't FlexTram. Shipped to both remotes (commit `58de694`) with a CLAUDE.md note claiming "every real push runs through the hook." **Wrong.** Diagnostic via `GIT_TRACE` + debug echo confirmed: the hook **never fires** when HTTPS auth fails, because git's HTTPS auth happens at the transport layer *before* git invokes any pre-push hook stage. The auth 403 short-circuits the hook entirely. The hook would only have worked if the wrong account could partially authenticate — but jmbradley gets rejected at the very first byte of the HTTPS request, so the hook stage is never reached. **Lesson:** don't claim a hook works without testing the actual failure path. Reverted via `git revert` (kept history honest with revert commit `bc5b818` rather than force-push).
- **Working approach: per-remote credential helpers.** Configured git's credential machinery to always source the FlexTram token (via `gh auth token --user FlexTram`) when authenticating to either flextram remote, regardless of which gh account is "active". Built as `scripts/setup-credentials.sh` (tracked, run once per fresh clone). The credential helper output format is `printf 'username=FlexTram\npassword=%s\n' "$(gh auth token --user FlexTram)"`.
- **Two non-obvious gotchas discovered during build:**
  1. **URL match requires `.git` suffix.** Config key `credential.https://github.com/FlexTram/flextram_landing_updates.helper` doesn't match the credential request because git's actual request URL is `https://github.com/FlexTram/flextram_landing_updates.git`. The trailing `.git` matters. Without it the helper is silently never invoked. Verified with `git credential fill`.
  2. **Empty-helper reset required to override gh's global helper chain.** The gh CLI installs `credential.https://github.com.helper` pointing at `gh auth git-credential` (which returns the *active* account's token — wrong for us). Without a reset, my URL-specific helper just gets *added* to the chain and never gets asked because gh's helper returns first. The reset pattern is `git config --add <key> ""` (empty entry) followed by `git config --add <key> "$helper"` (real entry) — empty resets the inherited list, then ours becomes the only helper at the URL-specific scope.
- **Acceptance test passed:** committed and pushed the World Cup post to BOTH remotes while jmbradley was the active gh account. No 403, no manual `gh auth switch`, no thinking required. The failure mode is now structurally impossible.
- Documented in CLAUDE.md "Git workflow" section as the standard fix; the symptom + manual workaround stays documented for fresh clones that haven't run the setup yet.

**3. Content shipped — "80,000 Fans. No Parking. No Walking. 300 School Buses. And Still Nobody Planned the Last Half Mile." (`/blog/world-cup-last-half-mile`, ~1,800 words, World Cup 2026 & Event Transportation — new category):**
- Riff on Fortune's May 25 piece about the 2026 FIFA World Cup transportation plan at MetLife Stadium. The whole national conversation is about how fans get *to* the venue ($98 NJ Transit train, 300 yellow school buses, $225 American Dream parking, walking ban enforced by NJ State Police, rideshare drop one mile away). Nobody's discussing the **last half mile** from the transit node through a reconfigured complex (parking lots converted to FIFA Fan Village + bus staging + operations) to the stadium gate. As of two weeks before the first match, no publicly available map shows the new pedestrian routes — because that part hasn't been designed.
- Position 1 of "More articles" grid, sitemap priority 0.7. Full SEO stack: BlogPosting + FAQPage + BreadcrumbList + Organization JSON-LD, OG/Twitter, canonical, `<picture>` element WebP + JPG fallback, 5 FAQs, 4-card related-reading cluster (the-pattern, parking-lot-still-1987, world-cup-fan-first-mobility, systems-over-units).
- **Reciprocal inline cross-links shipped same commit (Session 19 publish rule):**
  - `the-pattern.html` — added "the most public version of the pattern arriving this summer: the 2026 FIFA World Cup at MetLife" as inline anchor closing out the synthesis statement
  - `world-cup-fan-first-mobility.html` — added a parenthetical "(Updated — May 2026: the MetLife transportation plan has now been published, and it confirms exactly this gap)" pointing forward to the new post
  - `parking-lot-still-1987.html` — added "the most visible expression of the gap arrives this summer at MetLife" inline anchor in the innovation-timeline section
- llms.txt updated with detailed entry under Festivals/motorsports/golf/FBOs section.
- Hero image: World Cup trophy + Adidas tournament ball on stadium pitch. PIL-generated variants (1200/640 × JPG/WebP), 89KB / 48KB / 34KB / 20KB.
- IndexNow notification fired for new post + 4 cluster URLs → HTTP 200.

**4. Comprehensive site audit + 52-entry sitemap refresh:**
- **Site hygiene is in excellent shape** (this is the cleanest the site has been since Session 19):
  - 0 broken internal links across 1,300+ checked
  - All 74 sitemap URLs resolve to actual files
  - All 47 blog posts indexed in both sitemap and hub
  - All 20 solution pages indexed in both sitemap and hub
  - No duplicate titles or descriptions
  - No multiple H1 tags anywhere
  - No `<img>` tags missing alt attributes
  - No TODO/FIXME/HACK in code
  - No untracked junk, no tracked `.DS_Store`
  - No placeholder OG images (Session 11 sweep held)
  - No localhost URLs leaked, no ghost trackers (Hotjar/fbq/UA-*)
- **The one real finding: 52 stale sitemap `lastmod` dates** — sitemap entries dated days to weeks before the file's actual most-recent commit. Real SEO impact: tells Google "nothing changed" on pages that have, in fact, changed, reducing recrawl frequency. Fixed via Python script that pulls true last-commit date per file via `git log -1 --format=%ai -- <file>` and rewrites each sitemap entry's `<lastmod>`. Sample corrections: `/solutions/resort-hotel` (04-27 → 05-21), `/solutions/stadiums-arenas` (05-01 → 05-21), `/blog/world-cup-fan-first-mobility` (04-27 → 05-27 — picked up today's cross-link edit), `/blog/` (04-30 → 05-27). xmllint clean, IndexNow ping sent for sitemap.
- **Three smaller cleanups parked for later** (low urgency):
  1. 4 orphan template images (580KB total) from 2020 Paper Kit — `assets/img/sections/david-marcu.jpg` (577KB) + `assets/img/photo_swipe/{preloader.gif,default-skin.png,default-skin.svg}`. The photo_swipe/ directory is referenced only in `assets/css/paper-kit.css` (also dead code from the same era). Safe to remove if/when convenient.
  2. 4 hero JPGs over 400KB — `hero-festival-season.jpg` (638KB), `hero-planned-community.jpg` (529KB), `hero-labor.jpg` (434KB), `hero-convention.jpg` (415KB). WebP variants likely already exist alongside (per Session 17 site-wide WebP conversion) and serve to most browsers, so impact is on the long-tail JPG fallback path only. Easy re-run through PIL at q=85 when batching another image pass.
  3. `assets/img/404graphic.svg` is 1.1MB — investigated and determined the C2PA provenance manifest accounts for only 22KB (2%); the rest is the actual SVG path complexity. Not worth optimizing without rasterizing, which would defeat the SVG's purpose.

**5. Bonus: validated GA4 tracking on production via Claude Preview:**
- User reported "not seeing activity in analytics" after the World Cup post went live. Used Claude Preview to load the page and inspect both the GA4 stack (`gtag` function, `dataLayer`, gtag.js script in DOM) and the actual network beacon (`POST https://www.google-analytics.com/g/collect?...&en=page_view... → 204`). The 204 IS the expected GA response code; the `[FAILED: net::ERR_ABORTED]` next to it was from the response handling being interrupted by a subsequent navigation, not the beacon being rejected. **GA4 is firing correctly on production.** Most likely root cause of "not seeing activity": user was checking standard Reports (which lag 24-48 hrs) instead of Realtime → Overview (which updates within ~5 seconds). User confirmed "seems to be working now" shortly after.

**Commits shipped this session (pushed to both remotes):**
- `462f0de` — Document IndexNow manual-publish notification curl in CLAUDE.md
- `58de694` — Add pre-push hook enforcing gh active=FlexTram + doc the setup *(broken approach, reverted)*
- `bc5b818` — Revert "Add pre-push hook enforcing gh active=FlexTram + doc the setup"
- `574e694` — Pin git auth to FlexTram token via setup-credentials.sh — fixes 403 on wrong gh active account
- `c2b0201` — Publish '80,000 Fans. No Parking. 300 School Buses. And Still Nobody Planned the Last Half Mile.' (World Cup 2026 / MetLife)
- `894d8ca` — Refresh 52 stale sitemap lastmod dates from git history

**What changes for next session:**
- Fresh clones now need a one-time `./scripts/setup-credentials.sh` run. Documented in CLAUDE.md Git workflow section.
- World Cup last-half-mile post is the freshest piece on the site; watch GSC over the next 2-3 weeks for queries related to MetLife transportation, World Cup shuttle, NJ Transit fan transit, last mile event transportation. The post is timed to ride the late-May/June news cycle as the tournament approaches.
- Sitemap lastmod refresh should be a periodic ritual — every 4-6 weeks, or after any cluster of edits that touches many pages. Could be scripted as a session-end check.
- 3 smaller cleanups (orphan images, oversized hero JPGs, photo_swipe css references) sit on the punch list when bandwidth allows.

### Session 28 (2026-05-28) — GSC validates AI-search thesis, first Operator's Atlas ships, cruise-buyer-specific CTAs with mailto obfuscation + GA4 tracking, cleanup punch list cleared

Heavy single-day session. Six concrete shipments. Most strategically significant work of the project to date: the AI-search Boolean-query pattern documented in Session 25 is now confirmed at the top-of-GSC level, and we shipped the response — the first Operator's Atlas, built specifically for the AI-tool research surface that's driving the impressions.

**1. GSC top-10 query review confirms the AI-search thesis empirically.**

Joseph shared the GSC top-10 queries report (28-day). 7 of 10 queries match the AI-tool Boolean fingerprint documented in CLAUDE.md Session 25:

| Rank | Query | Type | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `flextram` | Branded | 9 clicks / 34.6% CTR / pos 1.12. Locked in. |
| 2 | `flex tram` | Brand variant | 7 clicks / 41.2% CTR / pos 3.35. Healthy. |
| 3 | `wicket facial recognition` | Mixed | 1 click / 25% CTR / pos 9.25. **Single body-copy mention of Wicket in parking-lot-still-1987.html (Session 26 post) is generating the page-1 ranking** — perfect proof of the named-entity density principle. |
| 4 | `"capital funding group" -site:reddit...` | Perplexity/Gemini fingerprint | Pos 3, AI tool researching CFG (named in senior-living-independence post) |
| 5 | `"cruise industry" -"sub" -"submarine" -"subs" -site:...` | **Cruise iteration round 1** | Researcher hit submarine content, added exclusions |
| 6 | `"cruise industry" -site:...` | **Cruise iteration round 2** | Same researcher, broader |
| 7 | `"cruise" "industry" "line" "ship" -"car" -"tom" -site:...` | **Cruise iteration round 3** | Same researcher, switched operator syntax + added `-"tom"` to filter Tom Cruise content |
| 8 | `"grand view research"` | AI tool citing GVR | Pos 80 (page 8). Noise — not actionable. |
| 9 | `"jackie endsley" "pga championship" "championship director"` | Named-person query | **Position 1** on her name + title. Quoted in build-to-operate-seam post. Top-of-page named-entity authority. |
| 10 | `"louisville" "data center" -"hiring" -site:...` | **NEW AI-search vertical** | Louisville data center researcher filtering out job listings |

**The cruise iteration signal is happening LIVE in this snapshot** — same researcher, 3 rounds, refining Boolean operators in real time. This is the strongest possible empirical evidence for the Operator's Atlas concept (parked 2026-05-16 for 2026-05-23 revisit, slipped to today). **Zero CTR on every AI-tool Boolean query** — confirms the prediction that AI tools cite without clicking; traffic comes via direct/AI-referrer attribution paths, not these queries.

The maintenance rule in CLAUDE.md — *don't prune named entities, citation density is a feature* — is now empirically validated at the top-10 level.

**2. Strategic discussion on atlas format before shipping.**

Before writing any atlas content, walked through the design space with Joseph:
- **How to optimize for robots AND humans without writing twice?** Landed on: the structure that helps humans skim IS the structure that helps AI tools retrieve. Both want H3-per-entity + anchor IDs, scan-friendly facts blocks, first-person practitioner commentary (the moat — Wikipedia can't write this, Perplexity can quote it but can't replace it), specific numbers over vague phrases, Q-style headers in pattern sections, and "Last updated" freshness signals.
- **Should we build an atlas per solutions card?** Pushed back hard. CLAUDE.md flags "twelve abandoned atlases" as the failure mode. Atlas format only works where 4 conditions hold: finite + named entity set, AI-search already querying for them, meaningful operational variance per entity, and B2B audience mapping to entities directly. By that filter: cruise destinations now, hyperscale data center campuses in 4-6 weeks if cruise works, then maybe NFL stadiums or Power 5 athletics venues — 4 atlases max total, not 20. **Solutions-card 1:1 mapping is the wrong model** because solutions pages are buyer-conversion (purposeful navigation), atlases are research-stage discovery (search/citation). Different funnel stages.

**3. First Operator's Atlas shipped — `/atlas/cruise-destinations` (15 entries, ~3,800 words):**

- **Research phase:** Dispatched a background research agent to verify facts on 15 destinations against authoritative sources (cruise line official pages, trade press, Wikipedia cross-references). The agent surfaced 4 substantive issues in my originally-proposed list: Bimini Beach Club is NOT cruise-line-owned (Resorts World Bimini/Genting owns it; Virgin Voyages has co-branded usage); Falmouth Jamaica is a joint venture with Port Authority of Jamaica (multi-line public port, not exclusive); Sir Bani Yas is an operating agreement, not ownership; Costa Maya IS owned by Royal Caribbean (acquired Sept 2024, $292M) but the Perfect Day Mexico expansion was just blocked by Mexico's SEMARNAT on May 19, 2026, with RCL withdrawing the proposal on May 27 (6 days before this session). The agent recommended swaps: drop Bimini + Falmouth, add Mahogany Bay/Isla Tropicale (Carnival/Roatan — has a category-unique "Magical Flyer" chairlift transit asset) and Amber Cove (Carnival/Dominican Republic, $85M owned destination, dual-berth). Joseph approved.
- **Final 15 entries** grouped by parent: Royal Caribbean (CocoCay, Labadee, Royal Beach Club Paradise Island), Carnival Corp (Celebration Key, Half Moon Cay/RelaxAway, Mahogany Bay/Isla Tropicale, Amber Cove, Princess Cays), Disney (Castaway Cay, Lookout Cay at Lighthouse Point), MSC (Ocean Cay, Sir Bani Yas), Norwegian (Great Stirrup Cay, Harvest Caye), Royal Caribbean again — in regulatory limbo (Costa Maya / Perfect Day Mexico).
- **Page structure:** editorial intro (~400w) + 15 entries grouped by parent company (~150w each, with structured facts block + first-person practitioner commentary + cited source) + patterns section (~450w covering tram-as-category-standard, pier capacity as binding constraint, capex expansion, owned-destinations-as-revenue-centers, ADA-integration-as-next-standard) + What's coming (~300w, including the Mexico regulatory situation, Perfect Day Lelepa in Vanuatu, Royal Beach Club portfolio expansion, exclusive-operating-agreement model) + Sources + last-updated date. Plus a callout block explicitly noting the page is maintained as the category evolves.
- **Visual treatment:** reuses `blog-post.css` but adds atlas-specific inline styles for the practitioner-reference distinction — uppercase eyebrow label ("Atlas · Cruise destinations · Updated May 27, 2026"), structured facts list with dashed dividers per entry, scan-friendly Contents block at the top, parent-company section labels with subtle horizontal-rule dividers, scroll-margin-top so deep-link anchors land cleanly below the nav.
- **Full SEO stack:** BreadcrumbList (Home → Atlas → Cruise Destinations) + Article + Organization + **ItemList JSON-LD with 15 ListItems** (each pointing to the entry's anchor URL like `#cococay`). Sitemap priority 0.8 (one tier above blog posts). Meta description, OG, Twitter, canonical, keywords. The ItemList schema is the key structural-SEO move: it tells Google "this is a curated list of 15 named entities" which is exactly what an AI-tool retrieval query is looking for.
- **No main nav placement** — atlas is landed-on-via-search reference content, per CLAUDE.md design. Discoverable via inline cross-links from cluster blog posts + sitemap + llms.txt + IndexNow.
- **Hero image:** real Nassau cruise port aerial (5 cruise ships docked side-by-side: Royal Caribbean, Carnival, Norwegian, MSC visible — flanked by Paradise Island and Nassau city, turquoise Caribbean water). User provided the source; PIL-generated 4 variants at 1200/640 × JPG/WebP (200KB JPG / 138KB WebP at 1200×722). Page shipped initially with a placeholder hero (copy of `hero-cruise-destination-transit`) then swapped to the real hero in commit `a98641f`.
- **Reciprocal inline cross-links per Session 19 publish rule** (orphan-on-publish avoided):
  - `blog/cruise-destination-transit.html` — anchor in the body paragraph naming RCL/Carnival/MSC/Disney destinations, pointing to atlas as "full operational catalog"
  - `blog/cruise-terminals-people-moving.html` — anchor in the owned-destinations paragraph
  - `solutions/cruise-terminals.html` — discreet "Reference: FlexTram atlas of cruise-line-owned private destinations →" link after the related-reading grid (preserves card layout instead of forcing a 4th card)
- **llms.txt** — new entry at the top of Cruise & port operations section, bolded and explicitly labeled "Reference content, not editorial" so AI crawlers categorize it differently from blog posts.

**4. Cruise-line-buyer-specific CTAs (mailto-only to `jb@flextram.com`):**

Recognized that cruise line destination strategy buyers have a fundamentally different sales motion than the festival/event personas the homepage contact form was designed for: multi-year strategic partnerships, not discrete deployments; senior personnel won't fill out a generic vendor form after spending 30 minutes reading a practitioner reference atlas; expectation is a direct conversation, not a procurement gate. Replaced all 5 generic "Get in Touch → /#contact-form" CTAs on the atlas with cruise-buyer-specific framing:

- **Mid-page CTA:** "Building or scaling transit at an owned destination?" → email Joseph (subject: "Atlas inquiry — cruise destination transit")
- **Bottom CTA:** "Talk through an onsite transit platform for an owned destination." → email Joseph (subject: "Atlas inquiry — onsite transit strategy")
- **Sticky CTA:** "Email Joseph →" (subject: "Atlas inquiry — cruise destinations")
- **"About this atlas" correction link** → email Joseph (subject: "Atlas correction")
- **Sources correction link** → email Joseph (subject: "Atlas correction")

Three distinct "Atlas inquiry" subjects let Joseph see in his inbox which CTA the buyer clicked. Nav "Get in Touch" stays at /#contact-form for site-wide consistency. Single contact path per CTA = no decision paralysis.

Joseph's email choice: `jb@flextram.com` (new flextram.com address for cruise-line strategic buyers; signals enterprise vendor positioning vs. the personal jmbradley808@gmail.com that the homepage form routes to). **Joseph needs to verify the alias is set up + receiving** before atlas-driven inquiries land.

**5. Mailto obfuscation via runtime JS (commit `2080f00`):**

User-prompted question on spam: how do we avoid harvesting? The 5 mailto links written in plain HTML would expose `jb@flextram.com` to crawlers; within weeks of indexing, the address would be on cold-spam lists. Shipped the JS-render-at-runtime pattern:
- HTML source contains `data-u="jb"` and `data-d="flextram.com"` as **separate strings** (no `@` connecting them), defeating pattern-based email harvesters
- IIFE at end of body reads the data attributes, assembles `jb@flextram.com`, sets the real `href`, and swaps "Joseph" → full address in visible link text via `.js-mail-display` spans
- Fallback `href="/#contact-form"` for no-JS users so the link still functions
- Verified via Claude Preview: all 5 elements correctly rebuilt; visible text shows full address after JS runs; zero pattern-matchable email addresses in the HTML source

Bar set: defeat the common email-harvesting bots that pattern-match `[email-like]@[domain]`. Doesn't defeat targeted JS-aware scrapers — but those represent 100× the engineering effort of standard harvesters for low payoff against a low-volume B2B atlas page. Trade-off accepted.

Also caught and fixed a doc-comment leak ("Mailto obfuscation: assemble jb@flextram.com from...") that would have defeated the whole purpose; rewrote without the literal address.

**6. GA4 click tracking layered onto the same IIFE:**

Mailto clicks don't auto-fire `cta_click` events in GA4 (only form submissions and Enhanced Measurement clicks register). Extended the obfuscation IIFE to wire an `addEventListener('click', ...)` on each `.js-mailto` element that fires:
```javascript
gtag('event', 'cta_click', {
  cta_type: 'email_atlas',
  cta_location: 'mid_page' | 'bottom' | 'sticky' | 'correction',
  cta_subject: <prefilled subject string>
});
```

`cta_location` is derived from the element's class + closest parent (`.post-cta-inline` → mid_page, `.post-cta` → bottom, `.sticky-cta` → sticky, else → correction). Both `cta_type` and `cta_location` custom dimensions are already registered in GA4 from Session 12, so atlas CTA performance will be sliceable in the existing Explore reports.

Verified via Claude Preview by simulating clicks on bottom/mid/sticky CTAs and inspecting the `gtag` call stack — all 3 fired the expected events with correct location labels.

**7. Cleanup punch-list cleared (1.3MB / 8 files):**

- **4 orphan Paper Kit images deleted:** `assets/img/sections/david-marcu.jpg` (577KB), `assets/img/photo_swipe/preloader.gif` (866B), `assets/img/photo_swipe/default-skin.png` (989B), `assets/img/photo_swipe/default-skin.svg` (1.6KB). Both directories now empty and auto-removed by git. Verified zero references in HTML/JS/MD/XML before deletion (the photoswipe CSS in `assets/css/paper-kit.css` lines 1154-1180+ remains as dead code — larger surgery to remove, parked for a future pass).
- **4 oversized hero JPGs re-compressed via PIL q=85 + progressive:**
  - `hero-festival-season.jpg`: 638KB → 369KB (-268KB)
  - `hero-planned-community.jpg`: 529KB → 342KB (-187KB)
  - `hero-labor.jpg`: 434KB → 305KB (-128KB)
  - `hero-convention.jpg`: 415KB → 272KB (-142KB)
  - Total: 2017KB → 1289KB, **36.1% reduction**, 727KB saved
  - WebP variants untouched (already optimized per Session 17 site-wide WebP rollout); only the JPG fallback path was the regression source.

**Commits shipped this session** (all pushed to both remotes):
- `92dfa93` — Ship /atlas/cruise-destinations (placeholder hero + initial CTAs)
- `a98641f` — Swap atlas hero to real Nassau cruise port aerial (5 ships at pier)
- `f355101` — Atlas CTAs: cruise-line-buyer specific — direct email to jb@flextram.com
- `2080f00` — Obfuscate atlas mailto links via runtime JS — defeat email harvesters
- (Pending — cleanup + GA4 tracking + this Session 28 log)

**What changes for next session:**

- **The cruise destinations atlas is now the freshest piece of B2B reference content on the site, intentionally built for the AI-search Boolean-query retrieval surface.** Watch GSC over the next 4-6 weeks for: (a) impression growth on named-entity queries (CocoCay, Celebration Key, Castaway Cay, individual destinations); (b) atlas appearing as the landing URL for cruise-iteration Boolean queries; (c) GA4 engagement time on `/atlas/cruise-destinations` (atlas content should run higher than blog content because the bookmarkable-reference format invites longer dwell); (d) `cta_click` events with `cta_type=email_atlas` — actual atlas-driven inquiries.
- **Decision rule on atlas #2:** if atlas #1 pulls citations + impressions by ~mid-July, atlas #2 (hyperscale data center campuses) becomes the next move. If it sits dead at 4-6 weeks, the format failed and we don't repeat it.
- **`jb@flextram.com` MUST be a working email address** for atlas-driven inquiries to land. Joseph to verify the alias is set up + receiving. If not, all 5 CTAs route to a bounce.
- **Optional next-week refinements** if traffic justifies: (a) cruise-destinations-specific OG image (currently uses the hero); (b) a small inline "Want notification when this atlas updates?" opt-in (maintenance form, doesn't compete with the email CTA); (c) Louisville data center post or hyperscale-campus content riding the AI-search vertical that surfaced in row 10 of GSC.
- **Photo_swipe CSS in `assets/css/paper-kit.css` (lines ~1154-1180+) is dead code** — orphan images deleted but the CSS referencing them is still there. Worth a larger paper-kit.css cleanup pass when bandwidth allows.

**Late-day additions to Session 28 (after the main log was written):**
- **WebP re-encode shipped (commit `d35eb4e`)** — modest 43KB savings across 4 hero WebPs at site-standard q=80 method=6. Closes the "oversized hero JPGs" line item from the Session 27 audit. Honest finding: existing WebPs were already near-optimal; the heavier file sizes were image-complexity-driven (busy festival/community photos) rather than encoder-setting-driven. Total perf-pass impact on those 4 heroes: 727KB JPG fallback + 43KB WebP = ~770KB across the user-facing serving paths.
- **`/atlas/` hub stub shipped (commit `8394892`)** — eliminates the 404 on the bare directory path. Minimal one-card hub with intro framing + card for the cruise destinations atlas + "what's next" note. `noindex,follow` while it's a one-card hub (thin content). **TODO when atlas #2 ships:** flip the hub to `index,follow`, add a second card, consider adding to sitemap.
- **End-to-end verification on production passed.** Atlas page returns 200 / 56KB; hero WebP + JPG + 640w variants all serving; 0 instances of `jb@flextram` in HTML source (obfuscation holding); 5 `data-u="jb"` attributes; 15 entry anchors; ItemList JSON-LD with `numberOfItems=15`; cluster cross-links live; sitemap + llms.txt reflect the atlas. GitHub Pages built the late-day commits successfully in ~45-70 seconds each.

**Highest-priority items entering next session (in order):**
1. **Verify `jb@flextram.com` is set up and receiving** — send a test from another address; confirm it lands in Joseph's inbox. All 5 atlas CTAs + 2 correction links route there. Without this verification, the first organic cruise-line inquiry bounces silently.
2. **Watch GA4 for first `cta_click` event with `cta_type=email_atlas`** — confirms the click tracking is firing on real traffic, not just simulated. Custom dimensions `cta_type` + `cta_location` are already registered (Session 12), so the events should slice immediately.
3. **GSC monitoring window opens now.** Calendar checkpoints: **2026-06-25 (4 weeks)** for first signal check on atlas impressions / cruise-iteration queries landing on the atlas URL; **2026-07-09 (6 weeks)** for the atlas #2 decision (ship hyperscale-data-center-campuses if signal positive, abandon format if dead).
4. **The Wicket signal validates the named-entity strategy empirically.** GSC showed `wicket facial recognition` at pos 9.25 / 25% CTR from a single body-copy mention in parking-lot-still-1987 (Session 26 post). This is the strongest possible empirical evidence for the CLAUDE.md rule "don't prune named entities, citation density is a feature." Future content should be deliberately named-entity-dense.
